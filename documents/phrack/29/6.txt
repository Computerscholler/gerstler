                  following: 1-5 designates the state in which the drawee bank
                  is located; 6-9 special collection arrangements.

              1-Head Office in Richmond, Virginia
              4-Deferred credit and the state of Virginia

*NOTE -- For further your familiarity with the coding process, on checks, these
         numbers appear at the bottom of the check according to the MICR Check
         Coding System.  The check number, the account number, and the ABA
         Transit Number will all be encoded in magnetic ink.  The ABA Number
         will be enclosed in symbols like:  |: ABANUMBER |:  The grouping of
         the ABA and Federal Reserve Codes will also usually appear at the
         upper right-hand corner of the check.

         Keep in mind that there are a great many checks involved in any
         banking procedure, and almost any transaction evoked improperly will
         draw attention.  Furthermore, the documents generated in a legitimate
         wire-transfer situation are quite extensive.  Should a transaction be
         noticed, and these documents are not available for scrutiny, again
         attention will be drawn to the situation.

        Wire Transfer Ticket               Cancelled Check (if used to
        Microfilm copy of check              purchase)
          used to purchase wire            Bank Statement (if funds came

Bank transactions must be swift and precise.  Amounts should be kept under the
$10,000 range in order not to immediately arouse suspicion.  Attacks must
executed correctly the first time, as there will be no possibilities for a
second chance.  Monies must be gathered rapidly and dispersed into various
outlets to avoid additional attention.  Transfers to banking systems whose
countries keep strict right to privacy laws, such as Panama, Switzerland,
et.al. are not recommended as the transactions are much more involved and there
exists a greater potential for error in international wire-transfers.

The preferred method of transfer of funds would involve one or more false
identities, complete with state approved identification or passport and social
security cards.  Bank Security Film is kept on file, so it would be preferred
that some semblance of disguise be implemented, ranging from hair bleaching,
sun-tanning, makeup, false accents, facial hair, etc.  Various accounts in the
assumed name would be opened in several cities with the minimum initial
balance.  Within approximately two weeks, funds of no more than $7500 would be
diverted to each account.  The funds would then be withdrawn in cash with no
more than $5000 from each account, the balance being left in the account.  Once
the funds have been made cash, they would then be distributed to foreign banks,
or invested in foreign markets to avoid detection by the Internal Revenue
Service.

Conviction for Illegal Transference of Funds is not recommended.
