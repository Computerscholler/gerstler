                  THIS ONE IS DEDICATED TO THE DC 2600 MEETING

Living in America, one can easily and falsely assume that there really is a
Bill of Rights.  On November 6, 1992, the right to peaceably gather was
suspended.  Even though the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that shopping malls are
"public meeting places" and not private property, it doesn't make a damn bit of
difference to pigs.  So here is a little information that may help you keep an
eye on them while they are so preoccupied with us.

If your shopping mall is not listed below, try scanning (MHz):

                 151.625 to 151.955          154.515 to 154.60
                 457.5125 to 457.6125        460.65 to 462.1875
                 462.75 to 462.775           463.20 to 464.9875
                 465.65 to 467.1875          467.75 to 467.925
                 468.20 to 469.975           851.0125 to 865.9875

Following the shopping mall list is a list of nationwide stores and their
security frequencies.
