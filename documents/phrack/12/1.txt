         Ok, so we made it through another few delayed weeks of saying a
release was coming soon.  But of course, I finally got motivated and got this
issue moving.  I'd like to thank many of the people who rushed themselves to
get their articles to me when they didn't know that the release was so soon,
and for those that haven't gotten their articles in in time (for two issues,
mind you [no names mentioned, of course, but I felt a denotation would be
sufficient to provide my feelings in the introduction]) a big, "Oh well."
We're glad you've continued your patronage (Ha!) with Phrack Inc. over the
past year and a half or so and a big thanks to all of the writers who have
kept the publication going for all this time.  But after this issue comes a
break.  Not a break in putting Phrack out, but a break in the grind and rush
to get it out as I did with this issue.  Phrack 13 will be EXTREMELY
different, and I guarantee that to you.  Phrack 13 will be released on April
1st (hmm...ring any bells?) so be watching for it!  Later
