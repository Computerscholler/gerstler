  Used to extract bit fields from a character string.  The result is converted
  to a signed integer value.


F$CFTIME (input_time, output_time, field)
  Converts absolute or combination time to the format yyyy-mm-dd
  hh:mmm:ss.cc.  This function can also be used to return information about an
  absolute, combination, or delta time string.


F$CVUI (bit_position, width, string)
  Extracts bit fields from a character string and converts the result to an
  unsigned integer value.


F$DIRECTORY ()
  Returns the default directory name as a character string.


F$EDIT (string, edit_list)
  Used to edit a character string based on the parameters specified in the
  edit_list.


F$ELEMENT (element_number, delimiter, string)
  Extracts an element from a character string in which the elements are
  separated by some specified delimiter.


F$ENVIRONMENT (item)
  Returns information about the DCL command environment.


F$EXTRACT (offset, length, string)
  Extracts a substring from a given character string.


F$FAO (control_string[,arg1,art2...arg15])
  Calls the $FAO system service to convert a specified control string to
  formatted ASCII.  This function may be used to insert variable character
  string data into an output string or convert integer values to ASCII and
  substitute the result into the output string.


F$FILE_ATTRIBUTES (file_spec, item)
  Returns attribute information for the specified file.


F$GETDVI (device, item)
  Calls the $GETDVI system service to return an item of information on a
  specified device.  This function allows a process to obtain information for a
  device to which the process has not necessarily allocated or assigned a
  channel.


F$GETJPI (pid, item)
  Calls the $GETJPI system service to return status and identification
  information about the running system or about a node in the VAXcluster (if
  the system is a VAXcluster).


F$IDENTIFIER (identifier, conversion_type)
  Converts an identifier into its integer equivalent, or vice versa.  An
  identifier is a name or number that identifies a category of data resource
  users.  The system uses identifiers to determine user access to a system
  resource.


F$INTEGER (expression)
  Returns the integer value of the result of the specified expression.


F$LENGTH (string)
  Returns the length of a specified character string.


F$LOCATE (substring, string)
  Locates a character or character substring within a string and returns its
  offset within the string.  If the character or character substring is not
  found, the function returns the length of the string that was searched.


F$MESSAGE (status_code)
  Returns a character string containing the message associated with a system
  status code.


F$MODE ()
  Returns a character string displaying the mode in which a process is
  executing.


F$PARSE (file_spec[,related_spec][,field][,parse_type])
  Calls the $PARSE RMS service to parse a file specification and return either
  its expanded file specification or a particular file specification field that
  you have specified.


F$PID (context_symbol)
  Returns a process identification number (PID), and updates the context symbol
  to point to the current position in the system's process list.


F$PRIVILEGE (priv_states)
  Returns a value of true or false depending on whether your current process
  privileges match the privileges listed in the parameter argument.


F$PROCESS ()
  Obtains the current process name as a character string.


F$SEARCH (file_spec[,stream_id])
  Calls the $SEARCH RMS service to search a directory and return the full file
  specification for a specified file.


F$SETPRV (priv_states)
  Returns a list of keywords indicating current user privileges.  In addition,
  this function may be used to call the $SETPRV system service to enable or
  disable specified user privileges.  The return string indicates the status of
  the user privileges before any changes have been made with the F$SETPRV
  function.


F$STRING (expression)
  Returns the character string equivalent of the result of the specified
  expression.


F$TIME ()
  Returns the current date and time string.


F$TRNLNM (logical_name[,table][,index][,mode][,case][,item])
  Translates a logical name to its equivalence string, or returns the requested
  attributes of the logical name.  The equivalence string is not checked to
  determine if it is a logical name or not.


F$TYPE (symbol_name)
  Returns the data type of a symbol.


F$USER ()
  Returns the user identification code (UIC), in named format, for the current
  user.  The F$USER function has no arguments.


F$VERIFY ([procedure_value][,image_value])
  Returns an integer value which indicates whether procedure verification mode
  is currently on or off.  If used with arguments, the F$VERIFY function can
  turn verification mode on or off.  You must include the parentheses after the
  F$VERIFY function, whether or not you specify arguments.
