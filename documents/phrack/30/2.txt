~~~~
The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, or CARL, is an on-line service
providing information from its member libraries as well as select information
databases.  The member libraries include Auraria, CU Health Sciences Center, CU
Law Library, Denver Public Library, Denver University, Denver University Law
School, Colorado School of Mines, University of Northern Colorado, University
of Wyoming, Government Publications, plus about five community colleges, Regis
College, Colorado State Publications, State Department of Education, Pikes Peak
Library, MARMOT Library System, and Boulder Public Library.  The information
databases include the following:  UnConver -- Article Access, "Facts,"
Encyclopedia, Metro Denver Facts, Info Colorado, Boston Library Consortium,
Library News, and New Journal Issues.

CARL is available via Telnet at PAC.CARL.ORG (192.54.81.128) and is pretty
clear to understand.  The Encyclopedia information database, unfortunately,
requires a valid username on the system.


COMPUSERVE ACCESS VIA INTERNET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can access CompuServe via Telnet through the gateway/concentrator at
CTS.MERIT.EDU (35.1.1.6) by typing "CompuServe" at the "Which Host?" prompt.

CTS.MERIT.EDU (35.1.1.6) is a Cisco terminal server installed primarily for
users of the Merit computer network in Michigan.  This machine has a bunch of
serial lines going in each direction to/from a Merit Secondary Communications
Processor (SCP), which is the entity that gives you the "Which Host?" prompt.

Some other of the Merit services (like outbound Telnet from "Which Host?") have
been intentionally limited so that they only work within Merit.  Part of this
is apparently for reasons of accountability and security (no random hackers
dialing in and hacking machines in New Zealand) and part is for access control
(ports are scarce and services have costs so they try to limit who uses the
thing to paying customers).

CompuServe bills connections via this link as if it were via Telenet (which is
EXPENSIVE!).  It's an X.25 connection somewhere at a decently fast speed.

If you have particular questions about all of the various services that can be
accessed through Merit, either through the terminal server at CTS.MERIT.EDU
(35.1.1.6), Telneting directly into a Merit SCP or PCP, or via dial-up access,
contact merit_computer_network@UM.CC.UMICH.EDU or INFO@MERIT on Bitnet.

For more details about what can be accessed via CTS.MERIT.EDU, stay tuned to
Network Miscellany for part IV in an upcoming issue of Phrack!


DATE AND TIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here's an interesting little trick.  Just in case you are on some system
without the ability to report what time it is by a command, connect via Telnet
to port 13 of an Internet Unix system.  This gives you the time and date and
then disconnects.  Some example systems of this include RUTGERS.EDU,
MICA.BERKELEY.EDU, UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU, and PIKES.COLORADO.EDU (example:
Telnet RUTGERS.EDU 13).


FTP
~~~
File Transfer Protocol or FTP is a way to transfer data or text files over the
Internet from remote sites.  The only problem is figuring out where something
is that you want to get.

The following is a list of sites accepting anonymous FTP user=anonymous,
password=login.  It was compiled by Jon Granrose with the help of a number of
contributors as well as a couple of lists that had been started.  If you have
any comments, additions, or corrections, mail them to odin@UCSCB.UCSC.EDU or
odin@ucscb.UUCP or 74036.3241@COMPUSERVE.COM.

MELVYL ONLINE CATALOG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This service is provided by the University of California schools.  It is
available via Telnet by connecting to MELVYL.UCOP.EDU (31.1.0.1).  It basically
provides information searching capabilities and provides literary sources where
the "keyword" that you used may be found.  It is relatively self-explanatory.


NAMESERVERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
By connecting to port 101 on certain Internet systems, you have connected to
the nameserver of that domain.  To get a list of all of the subdomains of the
main domain, type ALL.  A sample system is VIOLET.BERKELEY.EDU but be
forewarned that the output from typing ALL is *EXTREMELY* long on this
particular system! (Example: Telnet VIOLET.BERKELEY.EDU 101).


PUBLIC ACCESS UNIX INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For those of you that are still interested in more information on the Public
Access Unix systems that were listed in Network Miscellany II featured in
Phrack 29, here are a few more details.  For specific information concerning
the nodes discussed, refer to the previous article.

For those of you who are not local to a Public Access Unix system, Portal can
be reached via PC-Pursuit for $25 a month and a $10 access fee for "portal"
(off-peak).  For information, contact John Little (jel@CUP.PORTAL.COM).


The Big Electric Cat (dasys1.UUCP) claims to be cheaper than most well-
connected public sites.  They have special billing for "organizational"
accounts if you're interested and their standard rate is $5 a month for an
account (no time restrictions).  The Big Electric Cat offers a superset of the
USENET newsgroups as well as unrestricted mail (!), a simplified set of prompts
for most system functions, games, and several other features


The World (WORLD.STD.COM) in Brookline, MA (Boston) is a Sun4/280 running
Sun/OS 4.0.3 (Unix.)  They offer electronic mail (to most anyplace), USENET,
ClariNet and general Unix access.  They dial UUNET and other sites frequently.

To create an account you just dial (617)739-WRLD (9753) and login as user "new"
(the login prompt gives instructions).  They ask for some info (name, address,
etc.) and a MasterCard or Visa account.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY NETWORK INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a service which I, personally, have found to be extremely useful.  If
you need network information on virtually any system, connect to the University
of California at Berkeley Network Information at JADE.BERKELEY.EDU Port 117
(example:  Telnet JADE.BERKELEY.EDU 117).  Once you are logged into the system
automatically, it prompts you for a command or type "?" for a list of commands.
The help menu is relatively easy to understand.  You can get Bitnet network
table listings or Internet numerical addresses or Internet mail exchanger
listings or UUCP node information or UUCP node paths plus more.  It's very
useful in case you're having difficulty sending mail to a particular node from
your own node or if you're trying to connect to a system via FTP or Telnet that
your system doesn't recognize (i.e. get the numerical address from the server
and FTP or Telnet to the numerical address).
