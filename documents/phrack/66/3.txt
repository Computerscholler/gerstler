The Circle of Lost Hackers is looking for any kind of news related to
security, hacking, conference report, philosophy, psychology, surrealism,
new technologies, space war, spying systems, information warfare, secret
societies, ... anything interesting! It could be a simple news with just
an URL, a short text or a long text. Feel free to send us your news.

We didn't get any news from the Underground since our last phrack issue,
it means that one more time all the news reports are coming from
friends of our's.

It would be good if people who claim themself "underground" would send
us their news...

Is our underground dead? (apparently yes...)

--[ 2. "Hacker Hack Thyself" ]--
	by Kartikeya Putra <alienbaby@freaknetwork.in>


"All human beings, all persons who reach adulthood in the world today are
programmed biocomputers. None of us can escape our own nature as
programmable entities. Literally, each of us may be our programs, nothing
more, nothing less."

-- John C. Lilly, Programming and Metaprogramming in the Human Biocomputer


In the early 1970's, during the early days of Artificial Intelligence
research, scientists from the fields of psychology and computer science came
together to try to develop a new model of how the mind works. Their efforts
eventually resulted in the discipline now known as Cognitive Science. One of
the more significant books to come out of this early collaborative effort
was called Scripts, Plans, Goals and Understanding by Roger Schank and
Robert Abelson, which is still used by psychologists today to support what's
called the Information Processing Model of human cognition. I'd suggest that
anyone with a serious interest in reverse engineering themselves should hunt
down a used copy of this out-of-print book (try bookfinder.com, or your
local library). In it, the authors suggest that human thought is based on a
set of scripts (programs) for meeting personal goals in different
situations. The example they use throughout the book is a "Restaurant
Script" that tells people how to behave when eating out in public, in order
to meet the goal of getting fed. What would you do if you ordered a
hamburger and the waitress brought you a hot dog? Your scripts tell you how
to handle this situation, what to do when the bill comes, and how to handle
all the other transactions that take place in the restaurant environment.

Scripts People Live by Claude Steiner is a book about a form of
pop-psychology called Transactional Analysis. Here the author talks about
how everyone has a sort of running "life script" which is basically the
story of your own life as you like to tell it. Inside this script there are
recurring roles that are often learned in childhood, which inform us how
people are supposed to behave. I doubt that anyone ever reaches adulthood
with a completely accurate script of their own life story -- but if you can
become conscious of your script, it's possible to start improving it and
improving the way you write it as you go along.

Some of our most basic programming concerns what it means to be "good" or
"bad." When parents, teachers and other authorities are training us how to
be "good," often this has very little to do with doing what is right and is
more about training us to behave in ways that are convenient for them. Today
the task of programming "reality" has substantially been taken over by
television, which is like a mindcontrol device that sits in the living room,
hypnotizing a legion of glassy-eyed zombies. It is sponsored by corporations
who are not concerned with anything except selling their products. In one of
my favorite commercials on TV right now, this blonde dude -- who looks to me
like he knows he is about to become a complete tool -- holds up a McDonald's
chicken sandwich and proclaims, "Let's hear it for nonconformity!" Are you
kidding me? It's so phony it's almost avant garde. Andy Warhol would love it
-- I find it disturbing. I know that there must be a lot of people out there
who don't see anything wrong with this ad -- and others who even buy into it,
who think that eating a chicken sandwich for breakfast really is
"revolutionary."

When we were teenagers, some of us correctly perceived the system as a
hypocritical crock of shit and said, "screw this, I'm out of here." As an
adult with a little perspective now I can see that there's nothing wrong
with wanting to do your own thing, but rebellion against the system is still
a part of it. Maybe we found a peer group who claimed to represent "the
resistence," the anti-system -- but it's a trick, the anti-system is still
part of the system. By joining it you think you are becoming free, but it's
just a trick. As an "outsider," if you break laws or do things that hurt
yourself or others, you're just playing in to the role the system wants you
to play -- you're doing exactly what you are supposed to do as an "outsider."
The anti-system system is there because they need "bad guys," so that they
can play the "good guys" in comparison. If you are good and not one of them,
the whole system collapses. That is revolutionary!

The foundation on which this whole sado-masochistic world system is erected
is the perception of yourself as a victim. A lot of people are starting to
figure this out, and when that number reaches a certain tipping point it is
going to alter the structure of the matrix. Seeing yourself as the world's
victim is profoundly disempowering and keeps you locked in a cycle of
self-created pain and misery. We break free from this cycle by making a
conscious decision to accept complete responsibility for our own reality.
Get a copy of The Anger Habit Workbook by Carl Semmelroth and study it like
a bible. Drs. Barry and Janae Weinhold have an excellent series of six
e-books titled Breaking Free From the Matrix. There are a lot of wonderful
books out there to help us take control of our minds and emotions and break
free from the matrix of social power -- find them, and free your mind.

	The internet is the most reliable machine ever made.
	It's made from imperfect, unreliable parts, connected
	together, to make the most reliable thing we have."
    		- Kevin Kelly, Wired founder

Evolt.org is a world community for web developers and other internet 
professionals. We host discussion lists, publish articles on our 
website, and maintain a browser archive offering downloads of everything 
from Mosaic to Flock. From the beginning, our community has been 
international, anarchistic, and volunteer-run. If there is one thing 
that makes us stand out from other web development organizations, it has 
been our long-term focus on cultivating community. Yet as much as we 
have worked together, evolt.org's history is marked by heated turf 
battles interspersed with periods of inertia. We have struggled for 
years to find a balance between process, production, leadership and 
decentralization, while steadfastly maintaining our ideals and 
integrity. On December 14, 2008, evolt.org turns ten years old.

This is the story of our first decade, from the perspective of someone 
who has been a part of evolt.org since the early days.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1998 : ORIGINS
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Evolt.org began as a 1998 copyright dispute between Wired Digital's 
Webmonkey and some members of Webmonkey's web dev discussion list, 
monkeyjunkies. The high-volume list had been operating since 1997. 
Active monkeyjunkies members wanted an online list archive, so they 
could search for and reference past posts, but Wired (who had recently 
been purchased by Lycos) did not provide one. When one member, Dan Cody, 
as a service to fellow list members, published his own archive of the 
list, Wired's attorneys ordered him to stop, explaining they were 
reserving their rights to the list posts. Wired further explained that 
they hoped to post the archives at a later date, and include banner ads. 
  A number of the community raised a protest, and on December 14, about 
thirty people from the monkeyjunkies community left Webmonkey to form 
their own community-run list, and later, website, evolt.org.

Evolt.org was both an emulation of, and a response to, Wired Digital and 
Webmonkey. Pre-Lycos Webmonkey featured a regular staff of writers and 
web developers living and working in San Francisco, California, 
producing articles that were both informative and humorous. Silly 
analogies and crazy story lines made tech tutorials entertaining and 
accessible. Advertising was always prominent; in fact, Wired founder 
Kevin Kelly, has said that Wired "co-invented the banner ad." 
Monkeyjunkies, the mailing list, almost seemed an afterthought, 
bolstered no doubt by the magnetic draw of the groundbreaking sites with 
which it was associated.

Evolt.org began not with a website, nor with an organizational 
structure, but with thelist, a general web development list, in the vein 
of monkeyjunkies, but non-corporate, non-commercial, and archived 
online. Some of the original evolters had internet community experience 
going back to usenet, and more than anything, it was the idea of 
creating an online "community" to which they were drawn, and the idea 
that web developers could assist each other, peer to peer, on a 
worldwide basis.

In addition to the attention paid to a community-oriented model, 
evolt.org distinguished themselves from Wired and other corporate web 
development sites by eschewing advertising. Finally, evolt.org would not 
claim copyright on anything written by any of its contributors, beyond 
what is granted by the contributor when he or she publishes on an 
evolt.org list or site. In the spirit of open source, we were, and are, 
"a world community for web developers, promoting the mutual free 
exchange of ideas, skills and experiences."

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
1998-2000 : RAPID GROWTH
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

Evolt.org members organized themselves entirely through email at first, 
with direction taking place on the admin list, which was archived, but 
closed to all but admins.

Our main web development list, thelist, was up and running by early 
1999, and by June we were also running a content-managed site to which 
members could submit, rate, and comment on articles posted into several 
"centers" or web development categories.  Adrian Roselli offered his 
personal collection of browsers, and thus browsers.evolt.org was born. 
The admin group maintained systems, managed development, and acted as 
editors, still with no formalized structure. Some members would gather 
to code the CMS and other applications at codefests. Later we would 
gather for purely social purposes as well (aka "beervolts.") Admins 
worked hard at everything from evangelizing to coding to creating 
content.  List and site traffic grew rapidly.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-
2000-2002 : GROWING FLAMES
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

In early 2000, Webmonkey experienced an exodus of editorial staff, and 
later that year, monkeyjunkies shut down, with scores of displaced 
"monkeys" moving to evolt.org's thelist. Things were going great for 
evolt.org.

We tended to organize ourselves by list. After thelist was 
well-established, thechat began in 2001 as a place to chat about 
anything that was neither related to evolt.org or the web development 
business: "imagine yourself round a table in a pub."  Admins continued 
to communicate with each other via a closed list. In late 2000 admin 
began a new list for issues specific to the website. This new list, 
thesite, was open to all interested evolt.org members.

In early 2001, about a dozen the evolt.org admin group gathered at the 
SXSW interactive conference in Austin, Texas. The group included members 
from both US coasts, the midwest, Texas, the UK, and Iceland. It was 
cozy, with a dozen of us sharing two hotel rooms. And it was at this 
time that we began to attempt to organize ourselves into something 
resembling a traditional non-profit organization. We elected a board of 
directors; Dan Cody was elected chairman.

Shortly thereafter, the admin group broke out into a series of power 
struggles.

While we had been able to do a certain amount of big-picture planning in 
Austin, it was difficult to keep track of things once we had spread out 
again. We were still communicating mostly by email (on- and off- lists), 
by phone, and occasionally by IRC chat (a challenge, since we were 
spread over so many timezones worldwide), with rare face-to-face 
meet-ups as folks were able. However we ran repeatedly into walls, since 
we all came from different cultures, we weren't all always the best 
communicators, and our vision wasn't always consistent. Trying to make a 
motion and vote on it was an often cumbersome (and sometimes divisive) 
practice.

As 2001 drew to a close, the evolt.org admin community had many 
challenges to face, not the least of which was "process." How do you 
govern yourselves when you are unable to sustain a traditional 
organizational structure, and when can't meet face to face?

In early 2002 the organization learned that Dan was personally 
supporting evolt.org's site and high-bandwidth browser archive at the 
rate of $1000 a month. Many were concerned because evolt.org wanted to 
be able to survive as an organization regardless of whether any one 
member were available to shoulder his or her portion of the load. Long 
term survival of the organization became a key concern, known in 
shorthand as "the bus question." If any one of us were hit by a bus, how 
would the rest of us make it? Unfortunately, the ongoing discussion 
around power and leadership issues caused such a rift in the admin group 
that Dan Cody, our first and last official leader, resigned in May 2002.

Remaining members continued to struggle with organizational and 
financial issues. By this point, several of those elected in Austin had 
resigned posts for one reason or another. For the rest, it seemed that 
the offices held no real meaning in the context of evolt.org.

In search of order, we divided ourselves into committees, and continued 
attempting to establish voting and other processes. The closed admin 
list dissolved, and long-term planning moved to newer openly-archived 
list called "theforum." Seeking order, we hoped to solve some of the 
boundary and accountability issues that had led to the fracturing of the 
community. Yet the quest for process and organization itself became 
frustrating to many, because it often seemed like the majority of our 
energy was being spent on process and power issues rather than on 
achievement and moving forward as a group. At the same time, world 
events from the dot com crash to 9/11 to the 2003 US-led invasion of 
Iraq fueled emotional responses to exisiting tensions.  Once thriving, 
thechat erupted in flames, then slowed down considerably.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
2003-2005 : SEEKING BALANCE
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

By 2003, evolt.org had over 3,000 members subscribed to thelist. We 
continued to maintain the browser archive, and a community web resource 
directory, and for the past year and a half, had been offering all our 
members free web hosting as well. We still had essentially no budget, 
though by this point fundraising had become a serious focus.  In 2003 
evolt.org stopped offering free webhosting, and we finally allowed some 
google ads to be placed on our browser archive in order to help pay for 
our hosting costs.

Eventually most of the committees and smaller lists were shut down, and 
their duties folded back into theforum. We continued publishing 
articles, and hosting our main lists, but discontinued the directory. 
Meanwhile, it was becoming increasingly clear that evolt.org's custom 
Cold Fusion-based CMS was vulnerable to the bus scenario.  By 2004 we 
were down to one active CMS developer/webhost (lists.evolt.org at the 
time, was hosted the UK). As always, the heavy amount of responsibility 
taken on by a single person became a concern to others in the 
organization.  The group voted to move out of our custom CMS and into an 
established open-source CMS, Drupal. We found low-cost dedicated hosting 
at The Planet, and mirrors helped relieve some of the bandwidth pressure 
on the browser archive. The new Drupal-driven site went live in 2005.

We had finally managed to decentralize evolt.org to the point that it 
could survive the sudden departure of any one of its caretakers. 
Ironically, the rocky road to that place resulted in the loss of some 
high-contributing admins.

As for governing structure, evolt.org ultimately settled on an ad hoc 
consensus process.  One of us will propose an idea to theforum, ask if 
there are objections, and wait a few days for responses. If there are no 
objections, one assumes consensus and moves forward. If there are 
objections, we try to talk through them, rather than fight.  Also, we 
are no longer concerned with formalizing a hierarchy.

Those who have lasted through the years have progressed a great deal in 
their ability to work together. While we still face communication 
challenges, we are more familiar with the territory now.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
2006-2008 : INERTIA
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

As evolt.org admin has worked to put our organization in order, web 
progress has lagged. The patched-together 2005 design was intended to be 
temporary, but has yet to be replaced. In 2006 there was a failed 
movement toward redesign, and by 2008 our article submissions and web 
traffic had dropped noticeably. Activity on thelist remained steady, but 
at a lower volume than in years past.

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
2008 AND : OUR FUTURE
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

As we move forward into our tenth year, a few large projects lie before 
us. We are taking a step back, looking at how we are serving our 
community, and asking how we can do better. To that end we are surveying 
our community for input. In addition, we continue to work on improving 
our browser archive by adding more mirrors, and hopefully also adding 
more information about some of our unique and interesting browsers. 
Finally, we are taking steps toward truly internationalizing our site, 
so that we have the foundation on which to build localized versions of 
evolt.org, a vision we've had, but kept on the backburner, since 2001.

Though the journey has been far from smooth, we've managed to maintain 
the integrity of our organization, our community, our purpose, and our 
archives. We continue to welcome new members who want to contribute 
their talents and energy to the community, while learning new skills 
along the way. Like the internet itself, evolt.org is made of 
"imperfect, unreliable parts, connected together to create the most 
reliable thing we have."

Here's to a harmonious, productive, and successful next ten years.
