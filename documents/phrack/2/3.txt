          PIPE OR "ZIP" GUNS
          ------------------

              Commonly known as "zip" guns, guns made from pipe have
          been used for years by juvenile punks.  Today's Militants
          make them just for the hell of it or to shoot once in an
          assassination or riot and throw away if there is any danger
          of apprehension.

              They can be used many times but with some, a length of
          dowel is needed to force out the spent shell.

              There are many variations but the illustration shows the
          basic design.

              First, a wooden stock is made and a groove is cut for
          the barrel to rest in.  The barrel is then taped securely to
          the stock with a good, strong tape.

              The trigger is made from galvanized tin.  A slot is
          punched in the trigger flap to hold a roofing, which is
          wired or soldered onto the flap. The trigger is bent and
          nailed to the stock on both sides.

              The pipe is a short length of one-quarter inch steel gas
          or water pipe with a bore that fits in a cartridge, yet
          keeps the cartridge rim from passing through the pipe.

              The cartridge is put in the pipe and the cap, with a
          hole bored through it, is screwed on.  Then the trigger is
          slowly released to let the nail pass through the hole and
          rest on the primer.

              To fire, the trigger is pulled back with the left hand
          and held back with the thumb of the right hand.  The gun is
          then aimed and the thumb releases the trigger and the thing
          actually fires.

              Pipes of different lengths and diameters are found in
          any hardware store.  All caliber bullets, from the .22 to
          the .45 are used in such guns.

              Some zip guns are made from two or three pipes nested
          within each other.  For instance, a .22 shell will fit
          snugly into a length of a car's copper gas line.
          Unfortunatey, the copper is too weak to withstand the
          pressure of the firing.  So the length of gas line is spread
          with glue and pushed into a wider length of pipe.  This is
          spread with glue and pushed into a length of steel pipe with
          threads and a cap.

              Using this method, you can accomodate any cartridge,
          even a rifle shell.  The first size of pipe for a rifle
          shell accomodates the bullet.  The second accomodates its
          wider powder chamber.

              A 12-gauge shotgun can be made from a 3/4 inch steel
          pipe.  If you want to comply with the gun laws, the barrel
          should be at least eighteen inches long.

              Its firing mechanism is the same as that for the pistol.
          It naturally has a longer stock and its handle is lengthened
          into a rifle butt.  Also, a small nail is driven half way
          into each side of the stock about four inches in the front of
          the trigger.  The rubber band is put over one nail and
          brought around the trigger and snagged over the other nail.

              In case you actually make a zip gun, you should test it
          before firing it by hand.  This is done by first tying the
          gun to a tree or post, pointed to where it will do no
          damage.  Then a string is tied to the trigger and you go off
          several yards.  The string is then pulled back and let go.
          If the barrel does not blow up, the gun is safe to fire by
          hand.

              You should not attempt to register such a gun.
