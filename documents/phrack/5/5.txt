This file is of course about DMS 100. Expect full length files about the other
variations of DMS (DMS 200 & 250) coming a later date. Much of the information
in this file was obtained from manuals acquired from Jester Sluggo.  Note: IBN
stands for Integrated Business Network.
_______________________________________________________________________________

DMS-100
-------
The DMS-100/IBN consists of electronic business sets and standard telephones,
data units, and attendant consoles, all located on the customer's premises; and
DMS-100 digital switching, and support hardware/software, located at the
telephone company's premises.  Together they create an integrated business
communications network that provides an unparalleled combination of features
and benefits.

o  DMS-100/IBN integrates voice and data in a total business communications
   system.

o  Effectively serves all sizes of organizations, from small businesses using
   only a few lines, to the most complex network systems with up to 30,000
   lines.

o  The IBN system monitors and controls its own operations automatically;
   diagnoses problems; and in some cases, does its own repairs.

o  Fully modular, to meet present needs, and accommodate new features as they
   are needed.

o  Cost effective: Helps control communications costs through more efficient
   use of facilities; centralization of attendant service where needed; Call
   Dial Rerouting (CDR) to control and restrict long-distance calling; and
   network management.

o  Worry free operation-Northern Telecom's DMS-100 digital switches are backed
   up by highly trained telephone company personal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the other features that DMS 100 has include:

o  Automatic Route Selection - automatically routes long distance calls over
   the most economical route available.

o  Station Message Detail Recording - provides a detailed record of long
   distance charges, including the originating number, time, and duration,
   authorization code, etc.

o  Direct Inward System Access (DISA) - enables company personnel to use
   cost-saving company facilities for long distance calling, even from outside
   the company.

Telecom's proprietary Time Compression Multiplexing technology; Compatible with
existing computer and data terminal equipment, and is available in different
low-speed and high-speed models, to suit existing terminal capacity.

Benefits
--------
o  Combines with Business Set or standard telephone, to provide integrated
   voice/data communications.

o  Your data unit and telephone can operate together simultaneously or totally
   independent of each other.

o  Fully digitalized, eliminating bulky analog modems.

o  Ring Again (constant redial on busy numbers)

o  Speed Calling

   ---------------------------------

 This new "bomb" isn't really all that destructive, although I would hate to
be nailed in the head by a flying piece of it.  Use it to scare dogs, and to
just raise hell.


Materials: You will need- 1 nut, fairly large in size, 2 bolts, both the same
size, which will both be the correct size to fit in the nut.  You will also
need a box of strike-anywhere wooden kitchen matches.



Design: Ok, you got all your stuff?  Let's begin.  Take one of the bolts and
the nut and screw it about 1/4 the way onto the nut.  It should look like this
<sort of>
                        ___                       |---|
                        |  |______________________|   |
                        |   _|_|___|__|__|__|_|___|   |
                        |__|                      |---|
                                  bolt ^               ^
                                       |           nut |


 Ok, take the matches, and there should be a 2 colored tip on the end.  Well,
cut the top layer off (this should be done with a razor blade) carefully, as to
not set the matches off.  Ok.  Got that?  Good, now, take about, oh, four or
five heads, or if you're feeling kind of dangerous, and can fit them, try six.
Put the heads <white part> into the space that is between the other side of the
bolt and the nut.  Now, carefully, take the other bolt and screw it down kind
of tight onto the other side.  You now should have the 2 bolts connected by the
nut, and the matches in between this whole hardware contraption.

Now what??!?

Take this thing, and throw it at something solid, and hard, like the street,
for instance, and be sure you throw it kinda hard, and kinda far.  These can be
a lot of fun, and only take a second to build.
