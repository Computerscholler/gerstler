---[ Markus Hess ]---
   Recently the Phrack editors had the opportunity to talk to Markus Hess in
his tiny Hannover flat.  This special edition of the Phrack Prophile details
our conversation, as well as general background information about the German
Hacker.
   This Phrack Prophile is not in the same format as previous ones because of
the nature of the profile. In the next issue, we will reform back to the
orginal creator's format.
            AGE: 26
         HEIGHT: 5' 10"
     HAIR COLOR: BROWN
           EYES: BROWN
           FROM: Hannover, West Germany
PAST EMPLOYMENT: Software developer in Hannover.
         PEOPLE: Stephen Winero, Walu Holland (Other CCC members)

   Hess, most well known as the hacker who's exploits are detailed in
Clifford Stoll's _The_Cuckoo's_Egg_, "is as paranoid on the telephone as he
is on the computer."  Although he was very reluctant to talk to us, we did
manage to talk to him about hacking and _The_Cuckoo's_Egg_.

PHRACK: What about in a couple of months?
HESS: Yes, in a couple of months you can call.
PHRACK: Your not moving are you?
        (Knowing that Germans rarely ever move and their phone
         numbers never change this was a silly Q.)

   Unfortunately, our lack of German and Hess' weak English made
communication difficult.  He is a very paranoid person who was obviously
uncomfortable talking to us.
   Those of you that have read Stoll's book know that Hess was involved
with hacks on American Military Computers, and indirectly involved with
Computer Espionage and the KGB.  Phrack strongly discourages trying to
hack Military computers and particularly takes offense to computer
espionage.
   From the information we have gathered from him and by talking to him,
we feel that Markus Hess wasn't as smart as Clifford Stoll portrayed him to be.
We also feel that Markus was not working alone and that others were involved.
This however we cannot be 100% sure because of our communication faults.
