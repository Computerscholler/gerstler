        : :Introduction: :

     First of all MILNET is a system used by branches of the military for
unclassified communications.  MILNET produces that infamous TAC login xxx.  TAC
MILNET is run out of the University of Southern California.  USC is the ISI
master dial up.  I would also like to point out that the Department of Defense
tends to frown on people browsing through there system.  With that in mind,
here is a basic overview of MILNET operations.

        : :Logging On: :

    MILNET can be reached over through the "nets" or can be directly connected
to by dialing 1-800-368-2217 or 213-306-1366.  The later is the ISI master dial
up.  Most military bases connect through the 800 dial up owned by AT&T.

ISIE MASTER LOGON PROCEDURE
----------------------------
1> call 213-306-1366
2> when the phone stops ringing you are connected
3> enter location number (9 digits) + 1 or 0
4> hang up and it will call you
5> pick up the phone and hit the '*' on your phone
6> hit a carriage return on the computer
7> at the 'what class?' prompt hit RETURN
8> then a 'go' prompt will appear and log on as you would the 800 number.

MILNET LOGIN PROCEDURE
-----------------------
> When you first connect you will see:

'WELCOME TO DDN. FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.TAC LOGIN
CALL NIC 1-800-235-3155 FOR HELP
WRPAT TAC 113 #:36

> the person logging on types:

@o 1/103

 YOU ALWAYS TYPE @o then other connections are:
                          ISIA             3/103
                          ISIB          10:3/52
                          ISID          10:0/27
                          ISIE             1/103    (THE EXAMPLE)
                          ISIF             2/103
                          VAX A         10:2/27

> Next you will see a 'USER-ID' prompt. The first 4 characters vary but it is
is always followed by a '-' and what ever connection you choose.

User-Id:   (example)  CER5-ISIE or MRW1-ISIE

> The first three letters are the initials of the user followed by a random
number (1-9).

Access Code: (example) 2285UNG6A or 22L8KK5CH

> An access code will never contain a ( 1, 0, G, Z).

@ USERNAME + PASSWORD        IE USERNAME SAC.512AREFW-LGTO

THE USERNAME EXPLANATION:
-------------------------
     The first 3 letters in the example given above are SAC. This stands for
Strategic Air Command, a branch of the Air Force.  Following that is a "."
Then the unit number and the prime mission.  In this case 512AREFW", (512th
AIR REFUELING WING).  Then a '-' and the Individual Squadron name 'LGTO'
(LOGISTICS GROUND TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS), a fancy name for the motor pool.
     The password will not be echoed back and should be entered after the
username.  The new user password as a default is: NEW-UZER-ACNT.
