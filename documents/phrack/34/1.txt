     Welcome back to Phrack Inc.  From now on, the editorship will consist of
Crimson Death and Dispater.  We have decided to join both our forces and pool
our assets to make Phrack even better.  We will have accounts at various
Internet sites, however, all file submitions should be mailed to
phracksub@stormking.com.  If you do not have access to the Internet give Free
Speech BBS a call.  Crimson Death will take it from there.

     Special thanks this month goes out to Night Ranger for being great help!
Also thanks to Inhuman and Laughing Gas for taking the time to submit
material.

     Phrack has never really had a distrabution BBS, but you can always get it
on the Internet at EFF.ORG or CS.WIDENER.COM.  Off the Internet, the BBS
distribution will be from Free Speech BBS.  Below are a list of a few other
boards that carry all the Phracks.

                     Free Speech BBS     (618) 549-4955
                     Blitzkreig BBS      (502) 499-8933
                     Digital Underground (812) 941-9427
                     Pyrotechnic's Pit   (407) 254-3655

     We would also like to thank the nameless numbers of BBS's out there that
carry Phrack Inc. without their names being listed here!

     In this issue of Phrack Inc. we are starting a "letters to the editor"
section called "Phrack Loopback."  Any questions, comments, corrections, or
problems that you the reader would like to air with Phrack publically will be
answered there.  Loopback will also contain information such as reviews of
other magazines, catalogs, hardware, and softare.  With Loopback we hope to
make Phrack Inc. more interactive with our readers.

     This month we had an oportunity to interview one of our "hacker hero's",
The Disk Jockey.  We are also trying to "liven up" Phrack World News a little
by adding some editor's comments about recent news topics.  If we get a
positive response, we will continue doing this.  Hopefully you will respond
with your views as well.

Your Editors,

               Crimson Death                          Dispater

COMMENTS INSERTED BY SERVER:

	As the server of the Phrack Mailing List, I'd like to get a few
words in.  First, since I am currently a VERY DUMB list server, I am currently
not very interactive.  I am working with the system administrators and owners
to get an interactive "LISTSERV" onto this machine.  I would also like to know
if anyone can get me access to an IP address via SLIP at an Internet site
VERY CLOSE to the Newburgh/Poughkeepsie, NY area.  Another thing I could use
is a Phrack SubBot for IRC.  Something small that would allow you to get
information on the release date of the next Phrack, add your name to the
Mailing List, find out the Index of the last issue and such.  I can handle
awk, perl and 'C'.  An IRC connection (Not the server software) would also
be interesting.  Another thing I heard of and am interested in is something
that might start a seperate list.  There is a game, where you write a program
to make a robot to fight another programmed robot.  You run these against
each other to see who will win.  You can then modify the code to try again.
It needs to be compatible with an IBM Risc/6000 running AIX 3.1.5 running
patch #2006.  Help is also needed with SENDMAIL.CF configuration and etc.
Basically, if you have something that the SERVER might be interested in,
please mail "server@stormking.com". Also, if someone mentions that they are
not receiving a copy when they asked to subscribe, anything that DOES bounce
back here is automatically deleted.  For example, if something comes back
from SUSY.THUNDER@POKER.LASVEGAS.NV.CA (Susan Lynn Headley) and I am told
that POKER.LASVEGAS.NV.CA is not connected to CYBERPUNK.HAFNER.MARKOFF.NY.NY
I will NOT attempt to resolve the message.
