                                     Index

         Welcome to the long-awaited Phrack Inc. Issue 8.  I'm quite sorry for
all of the delays, but it's time to go back to school and it's been a hectic
summer.  Unfortunately, over the summer, Fatal Error of 617 died in a
motorcycle accident.  He was the sysop of Metropolis Elite and was around a
while back.  This issue is released in memory of him, regardless of any
personal opinions.
