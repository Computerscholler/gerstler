-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuc started out in the BBS world in July 1980 when he first got his modem, a
Novation Acoustic.  In August of 1981, Connection-80 of Stony Point, his first
bulletin board, was launched into the BBS world.  It started on a TRS-80 Model
I, Epson MX-80 printer, 2 single density disk drives, a Novation Acoustic
modem, and a home built auto-answer module.  At the time, he didn't even know
what phreaking was, so it was a general public board.  A software switch to
RACS III occurred on January 10, 1982, running until January 10, 1985. The hard
drive arrived a few months ago to build it to the board that it currently is.

Members of the elite world which he has met include King Blotto, Lex Luthor,
Dr. Who, Crimson Death, The Videosmith, Jester Sluggo, The Sprinter, Mark
Tabas, BIOC Agent 003, Agrajag, Telenet Bob, Big Brother, Cheshire Catalyst,
Egyptian Lover, Magnetic Surfer, Paul Muad'Dib, Lord Digital, Sir Knight, 2600
Editor (Emanuelle Goldstein [sp.]), Susan Thunder, Modem Rider, Sharp Razor,
Hertz Tone, The Flying Avocado, and The Ace.

His phreak experience began in March of 1982 through the new board's software
having a section called "Phreak-80".  People started calling and paying
attention to it, including one caller by the name of Susan Thunder, which is
how he personally began to phreak.  She lead him around the scene which
included the infamous 8 BBS and to other people such as Larry Kelly.  Some of
the memorable phreak boards he was on included 8 BBS, MOM, OSUNY, The Private
414 Board (as in THE 414's), Blottoland, The Connection, L.O.D., Plovernet,
Pirate 80, Sherwood Forest I, II, and III, WOPR, IROC, Pirate Trek, Pirate's
I/O, Datanet, Stalag 13, A.I. Labs, and Hell Phrozen Over.  He gives credit
for his phreak knowledge to Susan Thunder and the people that she put him in
touch with.

Tuc's work is as a computer and communications security freelance consultant.
He's done lots of programming in basic for the TRS-80, and assembly language
for the IBM 370.

Tuc does hack and phreak, but with his employer's consent.  Tuc attends the TAP
meetings in New York occasionally, but in the past he was a regular.  He's
attended all Phreak-Con's, he was an assistant editor of the original TAP, and
was a pioneer in the phreak world before blue boxing and Alliance
Teleconferencing was common knowledge.  Besides that, he was the one on West
57th Street labeled "Scott Jeffrey Ellentuch".  He was hard to find on that
particular program.

Tuc has been involved with various groups in his lifetime including (in the
order that he joined them) The Warelords, The Knights of Shadow, Apple Mafia,
and, at the same time as Apple Mafia, Fargo 4A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interests: Telecommunications (modeming, phreaking, hacking), martial arts
           (weaponry), radio controlled cars and airplanes, and video games.

Tuc's Favorite Things
---------------------

       Women: A quiet evening with the girlfriend.
        Cars: MG-TD Kit Car.
       Foods: Anything vegetarian.
       Music: The Hooters, and any band he worked for.
     Leisure: Having just a "good old time".

Most Memorable Experiences
--------------------------

Car ride with 8 phreaks in Tuc's VW Super Beetle at a Phreak Con.
The Fargo 4A stunt (getting all Fargo, N.D. DA's to go home).

Some People to Mention
----------------------

Susan Thunder (for getting him started)
All those that helped him while he was coming up in the world (too many to
                                                               mention)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuc is 150% against credit carding.  He thinks that is out and out criminal
activity, something that is totally against the code of ethics of phreaking and
hacking.  He also doesn't appreciate the fighting between phreaks that occurs
so often in the phreak world today.  He thinks the modern community is
crumbling.

I hope you enjoyed this phile, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  And now for the regularly taken poll from all interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  No names mentioned, but yes, a few of
the ones he has met are computer geeks.  Thank you for your time, Tuc.
