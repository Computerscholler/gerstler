        Preface:  This is not a particularly easy scam to pull off, as it
requires either advanced hacking techniques (TRW or banks) or serious balls
(trashing a private residence or outright breaking & entering), but it can
be well worth your while to the tune of $500 (five hundred) a day.
        Laws that will be broken:  Credit Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud, Mail
Fraud, Theft Over $200, Forgery, and possibly a few others in the course of
setting the scheme up (rape and murder are optional, but recommended.)
        This all grew from an idea that Poltergeist had about a year ago be-
fore he turned fed on Extasyy, and Cisban Evil Priest (Android Pope) and my-
self were implementing it with great success before our untimely arrest and
recruitment into the service of the State.  It is risky, but no more so than
some of the more elaborate carding routines floating around.
        The first step is to target your victim.  The type person you are
looking for is rich.  Very rich.
        Now, don't go trying to hit on J.P. Getty or Johnny Carson or some-
one who carries a high name recognition.  This will just get you into trouble
as everyone notices a famous person's name floating across their desk.
        Instead look for someone who owns a chain of hog feed stores or some-
thing discreet like that.  We targeted a gentleman who is quite active in the
silver market, owning several mines in South Africa and not wanting this to
be widely known (he had no desire to be picketed.)
        Next step, take out a p.o. box in this person's name.  Extasyy wrote
a good file on obtaining a box under a fake name, I don't know if it's still
around.  If not, there are several others out there.  (Yeah, I know, this has
already weeded out the weak of spirit.  Anyone who has gotten this far without
panic is probably going to get away with it.)
        Now comes the fun part, requiring some recon on your part.  You need
to know some fairly serious details about this person's bank dealings.
        1)  Find out what bank he deals with mainly.  This isn't too dif-
            ficult, as a quick run through his office trash will usually let
            you find deposit carbons, withdrawal receipts, or *anything* that
            has the bank name on it.
        2)  Find out the account number(s) that he has at the bank.  This can
            usually be found on the above-mentioned receipts.  If not, you can
            get them in TRW (easier said than done) or you can con them out of
            a hassled bank teller over the phone (Use your imagination.  Talk
            slowly and understandingly and give plausible excuses ["I work for
            his car dealership, we need to do a transfer into his account"].)
        2a) [optional]  If you can, find out if he has an ATM (Automatic
            Teller) card.  You don't need to know numbers or anything, just
            if a card exists.  This can also be ascertained over the phone
            if you cajole properly.
        3)  Armed with this information, go into action.
                a) Obtain some nice (ivory quality) stationary.  It doesn't
                   have to be engraved or anything, but a $5 or $10 invest-
                   ment to put a letterhead with his initials or something
                   on it couldn't hurt.  But the most important thing is that
                   it look good.
                b) Type a nice letter to the bank notifying them of your
                   address change.  Some banks have forms you have to fill out
                   for that sort of thing, so you need to check with the bank
                   first (anonymously, of course).  You will have to have a
                   good copy of his signature on hand to sign all forms and
                   letters (again, trash his office).
                c) Call the bank to verify the new address.
                d) IMMEDIATELY upon verifying the change of address, send a
                   second letter.  If he already has an ATM card, request a
                   second card with the business name engraved in it be sent
                   for company use.  If he doesn't have an ATM card, the let-
                   ter should request one for account number xxxxxx.  Ask for
                   two cards, one with the wife's name, to add authenticity.
                e) Go to the bank and ask for a list of all ATM's on the
                   bank's network.  Often the state has laws requiring *all*
                   machines take *all* cards, so you'll probably be in good
                   shape.
                f) Await the arrival of your new card.  The PIN (personal
                   identification number) is included when they send out a
                   card.  After picking up the card, forget that you ever
                   even *knew* where the p.o. box was, and make sure you
                   didn't leave fingerprints.
                g) Begin making the maximum daily withdrawal on the card
                   (in most cases $500/day), using a different machine
                   each time.  Since many of these machines have cameras
                   on them, wear a hat & jacket, or a ski mask to be really
                   paranoid.  To cut the number of trips you have to make
                   in half, be at an ATM a few minutes before midnight.  Make
                   one $500 withdrawal right before midnight, and another one
                   right after.  This cuts down on the number of trips, but
                   police or bank officials may spot the pattern and start
                   watching machines around midnight.  Use your own judgement.
       Conclusion: Before using the card, make sure that all fingerprints are
wiped from it.  Usually the first hint you will have that they have caught on
to your scam is that the machine will keep the card.  Also, avoid using mach-
ines in your own town unless it is a big city (Chicago, Milwaukee, Dallas,
etc...).

        Well, I hope this file has proved interesting.  Of course, it is only
intended for entertainment, and I heartily discourage anyone from even *think-
ing* about trying such a thing.  Jail isn't fun, as I can testify.  So I take
no responsibility for the misapplication of this information.
        (But if someone else pulls it off, I wouldn't be averse to hearing
about it...)
