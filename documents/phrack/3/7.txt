     Have you ever considered buying one of those hi powered microphones often
seen in eletronics magazines, but thought it was to much to buy and to small to
card?   The circuit shown in this file will provide you with the information to
build one for a lot less money.
     These audio eavesdropping devices are probably one of the hottest items in
the underground due to their ability to pick up voices through thick walls.
You can also attach the speaker wires to a tape recorder and save all the
conversation.   As one can see these are great for blackmailing a teacher,
classmate, principal, neighbor, or whoever you seek services from...
