     These little goodies are affectionately known as "nut busters." They are
simply shotgun shells enclosed in cardboard rolls with cardboard fins put on.
On the primer end of the shell is glued a small cork with a hole drilled
through it.  A roofing nail fits in the hole snugly enough to stay in, but
loose enough to plunge into the primer upon impact.

     Since the shell is not confined in the chamber of the gun, it will
naturally not cause the same amount of damage.  But if it goes off between a
fellow's legs he can look forward to becoming a soprano.

     These bombs are thrown singly or by the handful into the air over milling
crowds.  The weight of the shell and stabilization by the fins causes the nut
buster to head straight downward.

     It has tremendous effect as its presence is usually a suprise.  The threat
of more coming is guaranteed to route any mob.

     Not only does it go off on the pavement but it will also explode on
contact with a person's head or shoulder.  At night it is impossible to trace
its point of origin.

                      SHOTGUN SHELL BOMB


     A clever use for a plain shotgun shell is as a muffler bomb.  The shell is
simply shoved up a car's exhaust pipe with a length of stiff wire until it
drops into the muffler.  After a few minutes on the road the shell explodes,
totalling out the muffler and treating the driver to a sick kind of panic.
