The Circle of Lost Hackers is looking for any kind of news related to
security, hacking, conference report, philosophy, psychology, surrealism,
new technologies, space war, spying systems, information warfare, secret
societies, ... anything interesting! It could be a simple news with just
an URL, a short text or a long text. Feel free to send us your news.

We didn't get any news from the Underground since our last phrack issue,
it means that one more time all the news reports are coming from
friends of our's.

It would be good if people who claim themself "underground" would send
us their news...

Is our underground dead?

--[ 2. How is CSPP controlling US education network ]--
                        by dahut

http://www.mccullagh.org/db9/d30-32/kay-rosen-holleyman-1.jpg

The above picture shows Ken Kay, executive director of the Computer
Systems Policy Project on the left and Robert Holleyman, president and
CEO of the Business Software Alliance on the right.

CSPP (www.cspp.org) was created in 1989, and later on renamed as
Technology CEO Council. Bigger members are Applied Material, Dell, EMC,
HP, IBM, Intel, Motorola, NCR and Unisys. All these companies together
are generating 300 billion dollars of annual revenues.

The company was made on request of the US President, to promote
U.S. competitiveness through technology leadership. You can think
technology is for information technology. You are wrong. It's for
Intelligence technology.

The project is two steps. First is to invent a spy chip and
put it in every computer manufactured in US. So did Fairchild
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Semiconductor) by producing the
Clipper chip (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_architecture).
The Clipper was designed with internal circuitry to encrypt information
and deliver backdoor capabilities, a little bit as the previous PROMIS
software was doing with Mainframe.

The Clipper was designed for RISC workstation. After a bankruptcy of
Fairchild, and seeing that Hitachi was interested to acquire the company,
the US government requested Intergraph to continue the project. So
they did by starting the production of a new UNIX workstation line,
named Interpro32 and running AT&T Unix operating system.

So, the operating system was containing code to activate the secret
part of the CPU, and access to users' data. The following declassified
document explains to the US administration how dangerous it could
be to continue to use the Clipper chip in conjunction with AT&T:
http://www.softwar.net/bush.html. CIA and NSA are involved in this
document.

Now that the main US chipset and computer manufacturers are in the
secrets of the CIA intelligence, let's go for step two.

In 1996, the US president Clinton did ask to create the CEO Forum,
managed by Ken Kay, to establish the best rules for the future
classrooms, assuming they will be well connected to the Internet, with
the best possible hardware. Members were Apple, Dell, IBM, Compaq, HP,
Sun... Next, the US government did ask again to Ken Kay in 2002 to
create the Partnership for 21st Century Skills to be at the center of US
K-12 education by building collaborative partnerships among education,
business, community and government leader (www.21stcenturyskills.org). It
was a follow up to the CEO Forum.

Members are:

* Adobe, AOL, Apple, AT&T, Cisco, Dell, Intel, Microsoft, SAP, Oracle...
* National Education Association, Ford Motor Company (?) and the US
Department of Education

Ken Kay is in charge of driving all these companies to install computer,
software and networks systems in all schools of USA, as well as dictating
the content of the courses!

Thinking back to the picture in front of this article, you can make
the connection between all software companies, the BSA company and Ken
Kay. Thanks to the clipper chip success, they all know how to watch you!
The cherry on the cake will be to tell you that Ken Kay is managing WWASP,
the largest world network of special establishment for "Teens In Crisis".
www.wwasp.com

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Association_of_Specialty_Programs_
and_Schools

Many parents are complaining against the treatment methods employed by
WWASPS institutions. These methods are said to be controversial, as there
have been allegations of severe (sexual) abuse and torture by staff.
In 2004, during a testimony, Ken Kay stated that in his opinion, sexual
activity between staff members and students is "not necessarily abuse".
How do you explain that Ken Kay is controlling the whole US computer
industry, as well as the US education, and able to manage a galaxy of
establishments doing sexual abuses in its total acceptation?  (See also

--[ 3. Retrospective of The Underground scene ]--
                 by Duvel

Almost one year after the release of "A brief History of the Underground
Scene", it's now time to give some feedback. First of all, The Phrack
Staff and I would like to thank you all for your positive and negative 
comments about this article. The goal of this article was not to 
explain what the scene once was or what should be but more to provoke 
the debate. And on this point the article was a success. Now it's time 
to act.

About the negative comments that I had, I won't reply to each of one.
As you have probably seen, I didn't reply to any negative or positive
comments (except one at the beginning...my bad) I prefer let people
talk. But I was quite amused to see negative comments which for the
majority were on some insignificant points (speech recognition is not 
datamining, this guy doesn't know subnets, underground pyramid is for 
Holywood magazine or hacking tricks are too lame). It would be stupid 
to reply to them. So I won't.

One of the thing that I am the most happy about is that a lot of young
generations of hackers have found this article interesting and found their
way through it. As you have probably seen, there is another article about
the Underground scene in this issue. Anonymous' opinion is opposite
to mine but if you read beetween the lines, we both go to the same 
direction.

Of course it's important to understand the history of hacking (what
I tried to explain in my article) or how the underground died (what 
Anonymous tries to explain in his article) but it's more important 
to keep hackers alive. Even if the Underground won't ever be the same, 
the passion is still there. It's this passion of hacking that should 
stay alive.

I really hope that all people who gave constructive comments can
participate to the new Underground. A lot of people talk but don't do 
anything. I've seen lots of interesting comment from people who want to 
do something but at this stage we haven't seen anything from them. Are 
these people too busy? Are these people just dreamers? Are these people 
lacking required knowledge? Are these people....? I don't know.

But this message is for these people: please stop talking but try to bring
something to new generation of hackers.

They need you.

--[ 4. Killer robots ]--

My roomba can get lost under the dining room table, bumping off 
the chair legs, over and over. There are many routes of escape, 
but it rarely finds one. Only a true genius could turn this 
remarkable example of AI into a killing machine.


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/roomba-maker-un.html 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The makers of the cuter-than-cute robotic vacuum cleaner are 
rolling out a new machine: A big, fast-moving, semi-autonomous 
'bot capable of killing a whole bunch of people at once.

Unlike other armed robots -- which are entirely remote-controlled 
-- the Warriors are "being engineered with advanced software, 
giving them the ability to perform some battlefield functions 
autonomously."

At the same time, a key dimension to the Warrior X700 is its 
ability to protect soldiers by firing weapons such as a machine 
gun or 40mm explosive round. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Bring in the big guns.


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/10/robot-cannon-ki.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
We're not used to thinking of them this way.  But many advanced
military weapons are essentially robotic -- picking targets out
automatically, slewing into position, and waiting only for a
human to pull the trigger.  Most of the time.  Once in a while,
though, these machines start firing mysteriously on their own.

During the shooting trials at Armscor's Alkantpan shooting range,
"I personally saw a gun go out of control several times," Young
says. "They made a temporary rig consisting of two steel poles on
each side of the weapon, with a rope in between to keep the
weapon from swinging. The weapon eventually knocked the pol[e]s
down."

Mangope told The Star that it "is assumed that there was a
mechanical problem, which led to the accident. The gun, which was
fully loaded, did not fire as it normally should have," he said.
"It appears as though the gun, which is computerised, jammed
before there was some sort of explosion, and then it opened fire
uncontrollably, killing and injuring the soldiers."

    But the brave, as yet unnamed officer was unable to stop the
wildly swinging computerised Swiss/German Oerlikon 35mm MK5
anti-aircraft twin-barrelled gun. It sprayed hundreds of
high-explosive 0.5kg 35mm cannon shells around the five-gun
firing position.

    By the time the gun had emptied its twin 250-round
auto-loader magazines, nine soldiers were dead and 11 injured.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Can I play too?


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/12/new-killer-bot.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The stars: "a 25-year-old self-taught engineer named Adam 
Gettings"  and his "toy-like but gun-wielding robot designed to 
replace human soldiers on the battlefield."

Gettings' company doesn't have much of an online signature -- not 
even a website.  But he does have some interesting partners, 
including former Disney imagineer Terry Izumi (who cooked up this 
video for the 'bot) and shotgun maker Jerry Barber (who provided 
the firepower).  Blackwater has also endorsed the product, 
allegedly. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Blackwater and Disney? Who could ask for better qualifications? 
Oh, and there's this cool marketing video.


http://money.cnn.com/video/ft/#/video/fortune/2007/12/04/robotex.fortune


Robot wars, anyone?


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/05/top_war_tech_5_.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------

"The Baghdad bomb squad used their iRobots to decorate their 
shop," Noah reported after an embed with an Army 
ordnance-disposal unit a couple years back. "Not far away, at the 
U.S. military's central robot depot for Iraq, the iRobots sat on 
shelves, serenely gathering dust, while Foster-Miller's Talon 
robots would come back, scarred and in pieces, after being chewed 
up by a bomb."

The company noted that war zone "Robot Hospitals" are repairing 
more than 400 bomb-damaged robots a week to put them back into 
service.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


My bot can kick your bot's ass. Great. But how do they stand up 
against humans?

Not the kind of humans that throw rocks at tanks, but the 
thinking kind, like the ones that broke Israeli comms crypto 
during the recent war in Lebanon.

Let's see what happens when it comes across a carpet stretched 
over a pit. Or somebody throws a blanket over it, or spray paints 
the camera lens, or fires IR lasers or very bright oLEDS at the 
camera.

Once you have physical access to the thing, you own it. How hard 
would it be to re-chip the thing and send it back against its 
makers?

Can we test our killer-robot counter measures? Maybe. The 
opportunity may soon be as close as your local pigsty.


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/08/armed-robots-so.html 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Armed robots -- similar to the ones now on patrol in Iraq -- are 
being marketed to domestic police forces, according to the 
machines' manufacturer and law enforcement officers.

Foster-Miller, maker of the armed SWORDS robot for military use, 
is also actively promoting a similar model to domestic, civilian 
police forces.  The Talon SWAT/MP is a "robot specifically 
equipped for scenarios frequently encountered by police SWAT 
[special weapon and tactics] units and MPs [military police]," a 
company fact sheet announces.  It "can be configured with the 
following equipment:

 . Multi-shot TASER electronic control device with laser-dot 
aiming.
. Loudspeaker and audio receiver for negotiations.
. Night vision and thermal cameras.
. Choice of weapons for lethal or less-than-lethal responses
  - 40 mm grenade launcher - 2 rounds
  - 12-gage shotgun - 5 rounds
  - FN303 less-lethal launcher - 15 rounds.

In addition to the Massachusetts State Police,  SWAT teams in 
Houston, San Francisco, and Lubbock, TX all have the robots, 
according to Foster-Miller spokesperson Cynthia Black. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Finally, a legitimate excuse for Swatting.


http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In the field of Information Security, Swatting is an attempt to 
trick an emergency service to dispatch an emergency response 
team. The name derives from attempts to trick an emergency 
services operator (a "911 operator") into dispatching a SWAT 
(Special Weapons and Training) team to a location under false 
pretense.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


What next?


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2007/11/black-knight.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We now know that there are robotic cars smart enough to drive 
themselves around a city.  The next step: give those vehicles 
automatic weapons, of course. 

Or the troops can stay just chill out, and let the thing drive 
itself.  The Knight uses "advanced robotic technology for 
autonomous mobility," according to BAE.  "This capability allows 
the Black Knight to plan routes, maneuver on the planned route, 
and avoid obstacles - all without operator intervention."
--------------------------------------------------------------------


http://blog.wired.com/defense/2008/01/israel-thinking.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------
So Israeli military leaders have begun early planning for a new, 
robotic defense system, armed with enough artificial intelligence 
that it "could take over completely" from flesh-and-blood 
operators.  "It will be designed for... autonomous operations,' 
Brig. Gen. Daniel Milo, commander of Israel's air defense forces, 
tells Defense News' Barbara Opall-Rome.  And in the event of a 
"doomsday" strike, Opall-Rome notes, the system could handle 
"attacks that exceed physiological limits of human command."

How do you say "Skynet" in Hebrew, again?    
--------------------------------------------------------------------


http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUST27506220080408?feedType=RSS&feedName=oddlyEnoughNews&rpc=22&sp=true
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Robots could fill the jobs of 3.5 million people in graying Japan 
by 2025, a thinktank says, helping to avert worker shortages as 
the country's population shrinks.

Caregivers would save more than an hour a day if robots helped 
look after children, older people and did some housework, it 
added. Robotic duties could include reading books out loud or 
helping bathe the elderly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


Don't drop the soap.
