 Introduction
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Ok, well this is a simple text file that explains the basic commands
used by a VOS system.  VOS stands for Virtual Operating System and it is mainly
used by businesses but other groups have used it too.

        If you have any questions, you can reach me at this fine system:

        Legion (202)337=2844

        or if you have any questions you can e-mail the me at:

        Internet:  ukelele!kclahan@UUNET.UU.NET

        Special Thanks to:  Nat X, Beta Raider, Tomellicus and the
        anonymous site of my humble work.

        Ok, well VOS systems can be found in various systems around the world
and on many of the nets such as TELENET.  You can recognize a VOS system at its
prompt.  Which looks like this:

   Prompt->     (Name of System)
                System ???, VOS Release v.(version), Module ???

                (Or it just says something about a Release ver# and Module#)

        After getting the log-on message you come to the hard part, getting a
valid user/password combination.  To log-in, you type:

                Login <name> <password> <CRT>
        or
                Login <CRT>
                'User_name:' <name>
                'Password?' <password>

(by the way, <CRT> means enter and it comes after something you have to type
and words in '' mean that the computer is displaying that)

        When you get a valid name and password, it will say:

        <name> logged in on <module#> at <year>-<month>-<day> at <time> ETA.

        (then it runs start_up.cm)

        If you need any more help with the commands please try their on-line
help program by typing HELP when you are logged in or HELP <Command> and please
excuse the format of the command listings but if you would like a better
listing look for the COMPLETE informational guide to VOS systems by Dr.

 Security
 ~~~~~~~~
        The basic security for VOS uses ACL or ACCESS_CONTROL_LISTS.  These are
lists that the creator of a directory or file make by using the GIVE_ACCESS
command.  There are four kinds of security you can have.  They are as follows:

   For file security:

        NULL       -+-     That means you can't do anything with it.
        READ       -+-     You can READ it but not modify it.
       WRITE       -+-     That means you have READ and WRITE access to it
                             so you can modify it.
     EXECUTE       -+-     That means they can read it and run it.

   For directory security:

      MODIFY       -+-      That means you can add, remove, change, and
                              execute files in the directory.
      STATUS       -+-      That means you can display_dir_status and
                              view the current status of the directory.
        NULL       -+-      That means you can not access the directory.

        If you don't have the appropriate security for the directory or file it
is because the owner/creator of the file or directory doesn't have you on the
list and since this informational file doesn't contain the information needed
to get access to files that you haven't been given access to then it is
advisable to look for more informational files from [ECHO].
