Phrack is BACK!   Welcome to the first issue of Phrack Volume Four!  This issue
we feature "Exploring Info-America" by The Omega and White Knight.  Other
articles of note include TWO articles by Count Zero, Black Kat's latest
installment on his VAX/VMS series, and information on VOS by Dr. No-Good!
Also, starting this issue, we introduce Pirate's Cove by Rambone.  Its a new
regular column about the pirate community.  Finally, a very special thanks goes
out the the newest member of the Phrack Staff, Spirit Walker for the help with
assembling this issue.

There is a little surprise in Phrack Loopback.  Our old pal THE DICTATOR has
been corresponding with Knight Lightning and myself over the nets.  Yes, you
heard right!  Dale Drew, who played a key role in busting people during
OPERATION SUN-DEVIL and spying on our friends at SummerCon '88 is back and
believe it or not... he wants Phrack!  And speaking of Operation Sun-Devil,
the federal government convicted their first defendant -- details in Phrack
World News (Part 2).

Phrack World News (Part 3) contains everything you need to know about how
the Regional Bell Operating Companies feel about our private hobby bulletin
boards and next issue we will have information about what YOU can do about it!
Also, next issue watch for preliminary details for SummerCon '92!!!  Will
ESP be there again?

Before the rumor mill starts churning again, I will clarify what is happening
with Phrack management.  Crimson Death has decided to retire from Phrack and
start working on his new UNIX based BBS, CyberWaste!  If you are interested in
keeping in touch with Crimson Death, you may do so by writing:
cdeath@GNU.AI.MIT.EDU for the time being.  However, keep an eye out for the
CyberWaste hostname; @DEMONSEED.COM!

Well that's it for now.  If you are going to the Second Conference on
Computers, Freedom, & Privacy (a/k/a CFP-2) in Washington, D.C. (March 18-20,
1992), Knight Lightning and I will see you there!

Sincerely,
                                    Dispater
