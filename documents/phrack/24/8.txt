Greetings!  I have compiled information about the SACs for your edification;
these include 700, 800, and 900.

Most telephone users from the United States are quite familiar with 800
service:  A number that they dial and incur NO charge (not even message units
in most areas).

Then there is 900 service, which is what most people perceive as 'value added,'
i.e. you pay more for the information than for the transport of the call.
These vary typically from 35 cents to a few dollars for either a timed service,
or a 'as long as you like' duration-sensitive service.  There are two
sub-species of 900 service:  AT&T and "everybody else."

Finally, there is 700 service, which many people remember as Alliance
Teleconferencing.  This is the third "canonical" SAC.  With few limitations,
this SAC is given over to the IEC entirely.

Let's look at these in more detail.


800 Service
~~~~~~~~~~~
800 service is offered by various IECs.  Each NXX in the 800 SAC is assigned to
a given carrier, who is responsible for assigning numbers from that block to
customers, and providing 10 digit translation.

The carrier must have Feature Group D presence for originating calls from the
originating exchange (either direct, or through an access tandem).

In the future, when CCIS becomes wide-spread, a query will be made in the
database [Who gets 1-800-985-1234?] and the call will be routed appropriately.
To clarify:  Now the carrier is determined by the NNX.  In the future, the
carrier will be determined by the entire 7 digits.

A similar situation exists with 900 service.  Each carrier can reserve NXXs
from BellCore (the people who among a zillion other tasks are in charge of
handing out prefixes and area codes).  They're not cheap!  To get the actual
number is free (there are qualifications that I don't deal with), but to get it
'turned on' in a LATA costs you money, depending on:

     (1) How many prefixes you're getting,
     (2) Whether it's 800 or 900 service; and,
     (3) How many Tandems/End Offices are in the LATA.

It requires a discrete amount of labor for EACH office, because EACH routing
table must be modified.  However, I will be discussing 900 Service in more
detail later in this file.

When you, as Joe Customer, dial 1-800-222-1234 (made up number, please don't
bother them) it will initiate the following sequence:

     1.  If you are in an Electronic Office (DMS-100, DMS-200, 1A ESS, 5 ESS)
         the 800-222 will be translated to "AT&T" and will search for an
         opening in a trunk group marked for 800 origination.  Should none be
         found, bump to step 3.

     2.  If you are in a non-electronic office (SxS, XB, and some flavors of
         ESS), it will go to the access tandem that your office 'homes' on,
         where 800-222 will be translated to "AT&T."

         Note:  If at this point, the number doesn't have a translation, you
                will get a "lose" recording from the CO.

     3.  Find a trunk in a trunk group marked for 800 origination.  Should none
         be found, give the customer a recording "Due to network congestion,
         your 800 call could not be completed" or die, or whatever.  (Depends
         on phase of moon, etc.)

     4.  The end office will the send the following pulse-stream (in MF):
         KP + II + 3/10D + ST + KP + 800 222 1234 + ST

         Note:  This is a simplification; there are some fine points of ANI
                spills that are beyond the scope of this file.

         II = 2 information digits.  Typical values are:

         00  normal ANI .. 10 digits follow
         01  ONI line ... NPA follows
         02  ANI failure ... NPA follows

         3/10D = 3 or 10 digits.  Either the NPA, or the entire 10 digit
         number.  KP and ST are control tones.

     5.  The carrier receives all of this (and probably throws the ANI into the
         bit bucket) and translates the 800 number to what's called a PTN, or
         Plant Test Number (for example, 617-555-9111).  Then, the call is
         routed AS IF the customer had dialed that 10 digit number.  Of course,
         the billing data is marked as an 800 call, so the subscriber receiving
         the call pays the appropriate amount.


Of the 800 possible NXXs, 409 are currently assigned.  A long-distance carrier
can get one 800 and four 900 numbers just for the paperwork.  But to get more
than that, you have to show that you're 70% full now, and demonstrate a real
need for the capacity.

I have included the entire 800-NXX to long-distance carrier translation table.
Note that not every NXX is valid in every area.

NOTE:  Where local telcos, such as Illinois Bell, offer 800 service, they
       purchase blocks of numbers from AT&T on prefixes assigned to AT&T.  They
       are free to purchase blocks of numbers from any carrier of their choice
       however.

       This list also applies to the 900/OCN Translation Table (presented later
       in this file).


900 Service
~~~~~~~~~~~
As I mentioned earlier there are two flavors of 900 service, AT&T and
"everybody else."  Everybody else is handled exactly as the 800 service above,
except the IEC will probably use the ANI information to send you a bill
(either directly, or through your BOC, each situation governed by applicable
tariffs and contractual arrangements between the IEC and the BOC).

AT&T 900 is a curious monster indeed.  It was designed as a "mass termination"
service.  When you dial a 900  by AT&T (such as the "hear space shuttle
mission audio" number) you get routed to one of twelve "nodes" strewn
throughout the country.  These nodes are each capable of terminating 9,000
calls >PER SECOND<.  There are several options available where the customer
and/or the IP pay for all/part of the call.  The big difference between 800 and
AT&T 900 is >NOT< "who pays for the call" (there are free 900 numbers), but
"how many people can it handle at once."  The IP is responsible for providing
program audio.  AT&T is prohibited from providing audio-program services (i.e.
tape recorded messages).  As with any rule, there are exceptions to these as
well.

I have included the entire 900-NXX to long-distance carrier translation table.

Please note that this differs from the 800 table, because much fewer of the 900

700 Service
~~~~~~~~~~~
The last SAC we'll deal with is 700.  I've seen ads on late-night television
for Group Access Bridging service (GAB) under 700 numbers, with an elephantine
dialing sequence.  The one that comes to mind is 10041-1-700-777-7777.  If you
were to dial 1-700-555-4141 you will hear a recording announcing your
Equal-Access carrier.  (Some carriers ignore the last four digits, and any
700-555 number will give the announcement).

This is signalled the same as 800 service, and may or may not be billed
ENTIRELY at the discretion of the IEC.  In New York, under PSC tariff, you can
order 900 and/or 700 blocking as well as 976, 970, 550, and 540 blocking in
various combinations.

What in ONE carrier might be a customer service hotline (Dial 1-700-I AM LOST)
might for another be a revenue product.  There is LITTLE standardization of 700
usage from IEC to IEC.

The one last dialing pattern that is worth mentioning is what's called, "cut
through dialing."  Try dialing 10220.  If Western Union comes to your
town, you'll get a FG-A style dial tone.  Presumably if you had a Western
Union "Calling Card" you could dial a call.

                                   Glossary
                                   ~~~~~~~~
ANI - Automatic Number Identification.  An MF sequence that identifies your
      line for toll billing information.  Often confused with ANAC (Automatic
      Number Announcement Circuit) which reads your number back in a
      synthesized voice.

BOC - Bell Operating Company.  An often misused term that in general usage
      means, "Your local exchange carrier."  Since most of the telephones in
      the country are served by what used to be the Bell system, we tend to use
      the term.  The proper term in this case, however IS "Exchange Carrier
      [EC]"  They provide service within your LATA.

FG-A - Feature Group A.  Line Side termination for Long Distance carriers.  The
       old 555-1234 for Widget Telephone Company then dial an access code and
       the number style dialing is called FG-A.

FG-B - Feature Group B.  Trunk Side termination for Long Distance carriers.
       (aka ENFIA B).  950 service.  This is LATA wide service, and doesn't
       cost the customer message units.  ANI is only provided when the trunks
       terminate in the End Office (as opposed to an access tandem).

FG-D - Feature Group D.  Trunk Side termination.  Provides 10xxx dialing, 1+
       pre-subscription dialing, and Equal Access 800/900 service.  Only
       available in electronic offices and some 5XB offices (through a beastie
       called an Adjunct Frame.)

GAB - Group Audio Bridging.  Where several people call the same number, to talk
      to other people calling the same number.  "Party" or "Chat" lines.

IEC - Inter-Exchange Carrier.  Someone who actually carries calls from place to
      place.  AT&T, Sprint, MCI are all IECs.

IP - Information Provider.  Someone who sells a value-added service over the
     telephone.  Where you pay for the INFORMATION you're receiving, as well as
     the cost of TRANSPORT of the call.

NXX - Notation convention for what used to be called a "prefix".  N represents
      the digits 2 through 9, and X represents the digits 0 through 9.  There
      are 800 valid NXX combinations, but some are reserved for local use.
      (411 for Directory, 611 for Repair Bureau, 911 for emergency, etc.)

ONI - Operator Number Identification.  In areas with some styles of party-line
      service, the CO cannot tell who you are, and the operator will come on
      and say, "What number are you calling from?".  You can lie, they have to
      trust you.  They MAY know which PREFIX you're coming from, though.

PTN - Plant Test Number.  A regular 10 digit number assigned with your inward
      WATS line.  This may NOT be a 'dialable' number from the local CO.  (A
      friend has a WATS line in Amherst, MA [413-549, 
      dial the PTN locally, but you can if you come in on a toll trunk.)

SAC - Special Area Code.  Bellcore speak for area codes that aren't really
      places, but classes of service.
