Robert T. Morris Suspended From Cornell                            May 25, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the New York Times

Cornell University has suspended the graduate student identified by school
officials as the author of "the Internet worm."

In a May 16th letter to Robert Tappan Moris, age 23, the dean of the Cornell
University Graduate School said a university panel had found him guilty of
violating the school's Code of Academic Integrity.

He will be suspended until the beginning of the fall semester of 1990, and then
could reapply.

No criminal charges have been filed against Morris.  A federal grand jury this
year forwarded its recommendations to the Justice Department, which has not
taken any action.

Justice Department Wary in Computer Case                           May 28, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Matthew Spina (Syracuse Herald-American)

              "Is Washington Fearful Of Losing A Landmark Trial?"

Some computer experts theorize that the Justice Department, afraid of bungling
what could become a landmark computer case, still doesn't know how to treat the
Cornell student whose computer worm slithered nationwide in November, 1988.

A further concern in Washington:  A trial in the case might embarrass the
Department of Defense if its scientists are asked to detail how their computers
were among the thousands crippled by the worm.

For several months, the decision on how to charge 23-year-old Robert T. Morris,
Jr. had been before Mark Richard, a deputy assistant attorney general.  Within
the last few weeks, Richard made a decision that now is being reviewed by an
assistant attorney general, according to a computer professional who has been
talking with the Justice Department.

"I thought we would have heard something from Washington by now," said Andrew
Baxtoer, the assistant U.S. attorney who in November and December presented the
case to a grand jury in Syracuse.

The grand jury's report was sent on the the Justice Department, which refuses
to comment publicly on the matter because Morris has not been indicted.

"Within the next two weeks I assume that a decision will be made," said one
official.

"If they decide to begin an expensive trial, they have to make sure they win so
as not to damage future attempts to prosecute under that law," said Eugene H.
Spafford, an assistant professor at Purdue University whose analysis of the
worm has helped federal investigators.  "If they decide not to prosecute, and
the total thing that happens is he gets suspended (from Cornell), I will be
outraged."

So far, Cornell has taken the only disciplinary measure against Morris,
suspending him for the 1989-90 academic year.  But the graduate student left
the computer science department early in November, the day after the worm
spread out of a computer in Upson Hall.

Morris, a computer science graduate student, has been called the author of a
rogue computer program, called a worm, that was spread from a Cornell
University computer.  The program was designed to reproduce and infect any
computer linked to the Internet, a network shared by colleges, research centers
and military institutions.

However, experts say an error caused the program to replicate out of control,
sending thousands of copies into thousands of computers.

If Morris is to be charged with a felony, prosecutors would then have to show
he intended to destroy or extract information.

Proving that would be difficult since the program neither destroyed nor removed
information from any computer.

To convict Morris on most lesser charges, prosecutors would have to show he
intended to harm computers.

Prosecutors also could use a misdemeanor charge requiring them to prove only
that Morris gained access to a federal government computer. The worm did reach
computers at the Army Ballistics Research Laboratory and NASA's Langley
Research Center, among others.

Some computer experts wonder, though, if Defense Department officials will be
reluctant to testify publicly about how their computers were penetrated -- even
those computers holding non-classified information. In February, at a computer
convention in San Diego, Defense Department computer experts detailed some
security improvements made to the network since November, but then refused to
release copies of their presentation to people at the seminar.

The FBI -- which enforces the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 -- and some
people in the computer industry are pushing for a vigorous prosecution to
display a strong case against computer hacking.  Others in the industry,
including some of Morris' friends from Harvard University and Cornell, urge
leniency because he was trying to demonstrate security flaws with computers.

What's Happening:  Computer Security Up                            June 4, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from Gannett Westchester Newspapers

                   [Comments in brackets from Delta-Master]

High-tech companies are spending 64% more [than they previously spent] on
computer security, according to a recent survey conducted by the National
Center for Computer Crime Data in Los Angeles.  The group surveyed 3,500 law
enforcement agencies and computer security experts about computer crime.  The
prosecution rate is also up -- 6.4% in 1988 from only 2.4% during 1987.

Contrary to popular image, computer hackers aren't always young boys.  The
study found that 32% of those arrested for computer crimes were female, while
only 14% were under 21.  The study said 45% of hackers were 25 to 30 years old.

I do not know about you people, but the public's confusion about hackers starts
to bother me when they make errors.  Seriously, I know of only a few hackers
over the age of 21.  The fact that the newspapers also equate the thug-like
computer criminals with the mastermind-criminal type hacker (you guys) is also
pretty annoying, wouldn't you agree?  One key phrase you must note: "32% OF
THOSE ARRESTED."  Oh well, such are the mistakes of newspapers.

Public Service Commission Bans Operator Companies                April 24, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Jerri Stroud (St. Louis Post-Dispatch)

The Missouri Public Service Commission voted 4-1 last week to ban providers of
so-called alternative operator services in Missouri because allowing the
companies to operate is "not in the public interest."

Alternative operator services companies contract with hotels, motels colleges,
hospitals, airports, restaurants and other facilities to provide operator
assistance to customers using pay telephones or house phones.  Consumer groups
have complained about price-gouging by the companies nationwide.

Mark Wheatley, a lawyer for the Office of Public Council, praised the
commission's decision.

The Office of Public Council has received numerous complaints about excessive
rates and surcharges by alternative operator services companies, said Wheatley.
Some alternative operator services companies also have accepted other
companies' credit cards without authorization from the companies issuing the
cards, he said.

"We feel that it's an extremely important decision by the commission." said
Wheatley.  But he said he expects the companies affected by the ruling to
appeal.

Lawyers for the alternative operator services companies could not be reached
for comment.

In it's ruling, the commission said many consumers aren't aware of the rates
charged by the alternative operator services companies until they receive "a
bill for operator services at prices higher than those to which he is
accustomed."  Consumer groups say the rates often are twice or three times the
rates charged by better-known long-distance companies.

Even if an operator service company identifies itself when a consumer makes a
call, the commission said many consumers don't understand the significance of
the identification.

"If the end user is not educated as to the intricacies of using an alternative
operator services provider, he does not truly have a meaningful choice..." the
commission said.

The ruling only affects intrastate calls handled by alternative operator
services companies, but it may effectively prevent the companies from providing
interstate service as well.

The commission specifically denied tariff requests from International
Telecharge Inc. and American Operator Services Inc.  The commission also
directed three other companies -- Teleconnect Inc., Dial US, and Dial USA -- to
file new tariffs consistent with the ruling.

The ruling allows companies to operate who provide operator services in
connection with their business -- long-distance carriers and local telephone
companies, for example.  But the commission also placed limits on these
companies.

Under the ruling, operator services companies must:

     * Identify themselves to the caller as well as to the party being billed
       by the call (in the case of a collect or third-party call).

     * Quote rates to the caller or billed party on request, without charge.

     * Use calling card verification procedures acceptable to the companies
       issuing the cards.

     * Post in a prominent position the company's name, detailed complaint
       procedures and instruction on how to reach the local telephone company
       operator and other long-distance carriers.

     * Transfer emergency traffic to the local telephone company or American
       Telephone & Telegraph Co. until the alternative services provider can
       show that it can handle emergency calls adequately.

Fax Attack                                                         May 13, 1989

       "Governor's Attempt To Ban Unsolicited Advertisements Backfires!"

HARTFORD, Conn - The great fax attack of 1989 -- an all-out lobbying campaign
against a bill banning unsolicited facsimile advertising -- may have backfired
when the governor's fax machine was jammed for hours with unwanted messages.

Starting Thursday, May 11, and continuing Friday, May 12, Governor William A.
O'Neill's fax machine has been beeping constantly, spitting out unwanted
messages from angry businesses that advertise by fax.

The businesses oppose a bill now awaiting O'Neill's signature that would
prohibit them from marketing their products by fax without first obtaining the
permission of the recipient.  Violators would face a $200 fine.

Starting Thursday morning, dozens of Connecticut businesses faxed to O'Neill's
office a form letter arguing against the fax ban.  The stream of fax messages
was so constant (40 came in before 10 AM) that the governor's office turned off
the fax machine Thursday (May 11).

O'Neill's press secretary, Jon. L. Sandberg, said the governor still hasn't
decided whether he will sign the bill.  But aides to the governor said the
persistent lobbying campaign proved how annoying unwanted messages can be.  The
inconvenience was compounded because the governor's office was unable to use
its fax machine to receive information about spring flooding around the state.

Pacific Bell Plans Access To Computers                             June 9, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from Santa Cruz Sentinel (Section B)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pacific Bell said Thursday it hopes to compete with the
popularity of television by offering people easy access to computerized
libraries, bulletin boards and the use of electronic mail.

PacBell's California On-line -- which will be available to anybody with a
personal computer, telephone and calling card -- will be among the first in the
nation to use a graphic-based system that simplifies procedures so only a
rudimentary familiarity with computers is needed.

"It's going to offer our customers a supplement to their current leisure
activities... and among other things we've seen (in trials) a lot of people
who got away from the TV," said Roger P. Conrad, director of Videotex Gateway
Services.

"We feel this is a more productive way for people to spend their lives and we
think a lot of users are going to agree," he added.  Users will pay
"info-entrepreneurs" fees based on the time they use various services and will
be billed on their monthly telephone statements.  Unlike some on-line
information services, users do not have to subscribe ahead of time.

Conrad said the types of services are limited only by vendors' imaginations.
PacBell will make money by selling telecommunication line use to the companies.
