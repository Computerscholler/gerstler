                          Operating the IBM VM/SP CP

             (IBM Virtual Machine System Product Control Program)

                     An information article researched by

                                  Taran King

                                 May 18, 1989


This article is for the purpose of understanding the Control Program (CP)
portion of IBM's VM/SP.  This is basically a separate section of VM/CMS known
as CP (with full screen editors, the CP level is indicated in the lower right
hand corner of the screen and for line-by-line editors, before the command line
and after hitting carriage returns, it should say "CP") and it's purpose is to
manage real resources.  Any command that involves something outside of your
virtual machine must communicate with CP.  If CMS does not recognize a command
you give it, it will give it to CP.

The user generally enters the CP stage after a program flops or if you get
disconnected.  You can also enter the CP stage by hitting PA1 which is a
function key of sorts.  PA1 toggles between CP and CMS while on-line and if you
re-login after being disconnected, PA1 can be used besides the BEGIN command
which will be spoken about later in this article.

Generally, VM/CMS systems are well equipped with help files so if anything I
print becomes unclear to you, from CMS mode, type HELP CP XXX where XXX is the
CP command you want information on.

To start this article off, I'm printing off the IBM-Defined Class and the
Function Types as listed in the IBM VM/SP CP manual.  This essentially tells
you what privileges you have with your assigned class.

IBM-Defined      Function         User &
   Class           Type          Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~      ~~~~~~~~        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     A               O           Operations:  The primary sysop can issue all
                                 class A commands.  The class A user controls
                                 the VM/SP system.  Class A is assigned to the
                                 user at the VM/SP system console during IPL.
                                 The primary sysop is responsible for the
                                 availability of the VM/SP system and its
                                 communication lines and resources.  In
                                 addition, the class A user controls system
                                 accounting, broadcast messages, virtual
                                 machine performance options, and other
                                 command operands that affect the overall
                                 performance of the VM/SP.  The sysop controls
                                 operation of the real machine using the
                                 system control panel and console device.
                                 NOTE:  The class A sysop who is automatically
                                 logged on during CP initialization is
                                 designated as the primary sysop.

     B               R           Resource:  The system resource operator can
                                 issue all class B commands.  The class B user
                                 controls allocation and deallocation of all
                                 the real resources of the VM/SP system,
                                 except those controlled by the primary sysop
                                 and spooling operator.

     C               P           Programmer:  The system programmer can issue
                                 all class C commands.  The class C user
                                 updates certain functions of the VM/SP
                                 system.  The system programmer can modify
                                 real storage in the real machine.

     D               S           Spooling:  The spooling operator can issue
                                 all class D commands.  The class D user
                                 controls spool data files and specific
                                 functions of the system's unit record
                                 equipment.

     E               A           Analyst:  The system analyst can issue all
                                 class E commands.  The class E user displays
                                 the contents of real storage, performs the
                                 functions required to generate saved systems
                                 and discontiguous saved segments, and
                                 controls the collecting and recording of
                                 performance measurement data.  This class of
                                 user can display specified real storage areas
                                 on the virtual operator's console or on a
                                 spooled virtual printer, but cannot modify
                                 real storage.

     F               C           Customer Engineer:  The service
                                 representative can issue all class F
                                 commands.  The class F user obtains, and
                                 examines, in detail, certain data about input
                                 and output devices connected to the VM/SP
                                 system.  The service representative can
                                 establish extensive recording mode for one
                                 I/O device at a time and can cause the
                                 recording of repressible machine check errors
                                 to be initiated or resumed.

     G               G           General:  The general user can issue all
                                 class G commands.  The class G user controls
                                 functions associated with the execution of
                                 his virtual machine.  A general user cannot
                                 display or modify real storage.

    ANY             ANY          The ANY classification is given to certain CP
                                 commands that are available to any user.
                                 These are primarily for the purpose of
                                 gaining and relinquishing access to the VM/SP
                                 system.

The following is the list of commands available along with a brief description
as to what they do and/or formatting and then ending with the IBM-Defined
Class and Function Type.

* : From CP, one may use the * command to annotate the terminal console sheet
~   or the terminal display screen with a comment.  In other words, type * and
then any string of characters you would, for some reason, to be present on the
screen thereafter.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  N/A

#CP : This command is used to execute a CP Command while in a virtual machine
~~~   command environment without first signaling attention to get to the CP
command environment which means that when typing P <command> to perform a CP
operation, CP directly receives the command whereas CP <command> merely queues
the command from CP.
Privilege Class:  ANY

ADSTOP : The ADSTOP command is used to halt the execution of a virtual machine
~~~~~~   at a virtual instruction point.  The hexloc variable may be placed
after the word ADSTOP which is a 6 character hexadecimal representation of the
virtual instruction address where the execution is to be halted.  The OFF
option of the ADSTOP command cancels any previous ADSTOP setting.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   identify yourself to the system and to access that
system.  Following the words LOGIN or LOGON or L, type your userid which is
the identifier assigned to you in the system.  If the system you are logging
onto does NOT have password suppression, your password can follow directly
after your userid.  NOTE:  If the system you are on does have password
suppression (i.e.  it does not echo to your screen what you type when you type
your password), you will get a system error message if you try to put it on
the same line as your userid.  The NOIPL option, which would follow your
password and userid, specifies that the IPL device or name in the directory
should not be used for an automatic IPL.
Privilege Class:  ANY
Function Type:  ANY

MESSAGE or MSG or M : Use the MESSAGE command to transmit message text to a
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   specified userid or to the primary system operator
userid.  MSG userid msgtext sends msgtext to the userid specified after

~~~~~~~~~~   determine your system status and machine configuration.
Although there are far too many subcommands of the QUERY command, the
following is a list of items that may be queried.  I recommend, for full
detail, using the HELP CP QUERY command as it is quite thorough (over 1000
lines) in explaining the QUERY command.

  o  The time you have used during a terminal session.
  o  The number of closed input and output spool files associated with
     your virtual machine.
  o  The current settings of the color and/or extended highlight values
     in effect for your virtual machine console.
  o  The current settings of the SET command functions.
  o  The current settings of the TERMINAL command functions.
  o  The status of all the devices on your virtual machine.
  o  The channel operating mode of your virtual machine, whether
     block-multiplexer or selector.

  o  A listing of the PER traceset elements.
  o  The log messages of the day.
  o  The names of the users that are logged on.
  o  The number of users that are logged on or dialed to the system.

NOTE:  There are other operands you can use with the QUERY command if you
       have the privilege class required to use them.
Privilege Class:  A, B, C, D, E, F, G
Function Type:  O, R, P, S, A, C, G

from a PROFILE EXEC because the SCREEN command is not device dependent.
However, the SCREEN command is only valid when the Extended Color Feature has
been applied to the terminal controller.

You can assign extended color and extended highlighting values to six distinct
display screen areas:  the input area, the system status area, and the output
area that encompasses three other areas: CP output, virtual machine output,
virtual machine output, and an input redisplay area.  The physical attributes
of 3270 Information Display station screens vary according to model.

Because this command mainly applies to people who are not on dial-up, I have
elected not to detail all of the variables available with the SCREEN command.
Once again, I recommend you using HELP CP SCREEN for details.

TRACE or TR : Use the TRACE command to trace specified virtual machine
~~~~~~~~~~~   activity and to record the results at the terminal, on a virtual
spooled printer, or on both terminal and printer.  If you issue more than one
TRACE command, the operands are cumulative; that is, operands specified for the
first time are activated, whereas those specified with new modifiers are
updated.  The RUN and NORUN operands, however, can be specified in different
tracing functions and do not cause a conflict.

You cannot issue the TRACE command while preferred machine assist is
operating, whether or not you have enabled the preferred machine assist
feature's control switch assist.

This article is far from totally complete as far as in-depthness goes.  As I
have stated in numerous portions of this file, the VM/CMS system has a very
good HELP file system, and from CMS, the command HELP CP <command> will, in
most cases, allow you to read a relatively clear text file containing the
details and usage specifications of these commands.  I hope that, should you be
moving around a VM/CMS system, this file will assist you in the CP mode.
