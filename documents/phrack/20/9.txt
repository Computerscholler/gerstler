Ok, please note, the characters portrayed here are fictional.

Picture a bar full of phone phreaks.  Jester Sluggo walks in drunk.  He goes
to the front and gets a beer.  He chugs it and looks at the people on the left
side of the bar and says, "ALL OF YOU ON THIS SIDE OF THE BAR ARE
MOTHERFUCKERS!  ANY OF YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?"  "No not me they cried,
not wanting to incure damage.  Sluggo chugs another beer and then looks up and
says, "ALL OF YOU ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BAR ARE COCKSUCKERS!  ANY OF YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?"  "No not I,"they all cried.  Then suddenly a small
figured mexican national stood up and started walking towards Sluggo.  "YOU
GOT A PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING I SAID," he belched.  "No no senor, I was on the
wrong side of the bar."

I've talked to this fellow and he doesn't know a hell of a lot about phreaking
but seems to know a bit about hacking anyway.  You may have seen him on Phreak
Klass Room 2600 too, but I don't know since I'm not on there.  So what do ya
think?

I've seen some of his posts of Phreak Klass and they're okay.  Althoug like he
said, his files are a tad outdated.  I never really talked to him personally,
so I'm undecided...

also friends with Lefty Carlson, Fatal Error 313, Mic Ripoff, Silent Rebel/
Phantom Fighter, and Striker (not the one from the IBM pirate boards I don't

Date: 12:19 am  Sat May 09, 1987

And for the record this is on the wrong sub, the idea of death in the phreak
world has really been "getting busted" or "retiring."  That is the only way we
can really think about it in our society, I mean cause phreaks just don't die
everday, but they do get busted about that often, so that gives us a more
realistic view if we were to look at the phreak zone as a true realm.

 Fatal Error 617 died from a motorcycle accident while riding in his woods.
Micro Man (617, was sysop of Newsweek BBS) called me and told me this on July
3, 1986. I guess no one else heard about this for a while, I remember the date
because it was right before the fourth of July. FE 617 was into COSMOS and ran
Metropolis, as someone said. FE 313 is a vocal phreaker and (as far as I know)
doesn't have a modem.

I sorry butz I say no to Galactus...I don't think he's good enough to be on MSP
(not saying I am good either). Some of the stuff here is not fit for thte
irresponsible...I don't believe that he is 21 for some strange reason. Oh well
trying not to discriminate but I say definately no.

I myself was unimpressed by his resume and the conversation we (Taran and I)
had with Galactus clearly has left a mark with me that he doesn't deserve a
place on MSP at this time.

26/46: NO

 My vote on Galactus is NO. Yes, I am conceited as hell, an asshole, etc. I
always feel like a jerk when I vote 'NO' because I feel like a segragationist.

   Galactacus (whatever the fuck his name is) is a knowledgeable person, but
I think he could still go awhile before getting let on.   Sigh, he is a Prime
person tho (hell, practically inspired me to write a Prime file when I read
that pathetic thing from way back).

Still, its no.

28/46: Guess its No, yes?

becoming a member here.  Whats the woid Taran?

:Knight Lightning


29/46: theres no way
Name: <<< Lex Luthor 36 >>>
Date: 10:46 am  Fri May 15, 1987

There is no way Galactus "knows very well" all those OS's
I would say 3 operating systems is the maximum for most hackers as far as a
complete (its never really complete) knowledge of OS's is concerned. Hell I
know VMS, UNIX, and VM/CMS very well but thats it. The rest I know enough to
get around in. OS's are like languages, people know a few words in spanish or
french but don't know how to speak fluently in those languages, but they still
tell people they can. That is what hackers do. I find this mainly on their
applications. Most hackers specialize in one operating system. Sometimes they
move on and specialize in others, sometimes they stick to the one they like.

   Galac., doesn't sound like a honest to goodness hacker.  He probably calls
us his local UNIX system and uses defaults to hack it out.

   Sounding sarcastic, but you know how it is.  1987 for users is really lousy.

   What are the specifications for electing a new person to the system.  I
have someone of interest.

32/46: Users...
Name: <<< Taran King 1 >>>
Date: 7:07 pm  Thu May 21, 1987

The user must be experienced in some manner or have a good general knowledge
of telecommunications.  If you wish for someone to get access here, have them
make out an application for themselves, get it from them, and then upload it
to the D: drive on the AE and I'll put it up as a message.

We shall wait until Galactus shows himself more worthy of being on the board.
Now we come to the problem with Solid State.  He was kicked off not too long
ago but he wants back on (I guess).  One way or another, he said he'd be
writing up "his side" of the story so at least we'll all get to hear what he
has to say for himself.  Life is a bitch...
-TK


33/46: well...
Name: <<< Sir Francis Drake 56 >>>
Date: 7:01 pm  Fri May 22, 1987

just to get my remarks in early...Iv talked to State & Stan about it and I
think State should be let back on.

He was kicked off because he SUPPOSEDLY read msgs to/gave his pswd to Stanly.
Now this info mainly came from Stan who would claim that he used states
password "all the time".  Now since, stan is such a notorious liar the
whole thing is obviously questionable.

Now another main complaint (from what ive gathered talking to KL) is that
State would not tell TK/KL how Stan gets on MSP even though State apparently
knows.  This may sound sorta lame, but if State starts telling on stan he
wont be trusted, and it would be lame of him.

So it would seem that as long as State does not further help stand (which is
EXTRENELY unlikely even if he ever did) Stan he should be let back on as he
was/will be a "valuable user".

so there.

I don't want to start a debate because Craig's gonna be here real soon
preaching about everything but I'd just like to have it stated that I've got a
neutral 3rd party that was on a conversation between Stan and Nate where Nate
was reading posts from MSP, which I had previously told him was grounds for
deletion from MSP if he read them to Stan.  Thank you and here's my address
-TK


35/46: Preech!
Name: <<< Knight Lightning 2 >>>
Date: 11:58 pm  Sat May 23, 1987

This is true.  In OQ's own word's "Nate is my partner in crime."  Now perhaps
you may call OQ a liar or say he is bluffing, but their friendship exists for
better or for worse.  Now both OQ and SS claim to have at least 3 or more
accounts on here anyway and Stan would like his own account to post with as
well (yeah yeah, why'd you even mention it KL, it'll never happen).  As good a
hacker that State is, I am not convinced that he should be trusted in any
aspect towards the system especially since he has aided succesful attempts to
breech its security.  I mean, thats just the way it is, nothing seems to ever
change, etc.

One other thing to mention, its not like we "owe" anyone an account and
although I suppose I have a lot of pull, Taran King will have the final say.
