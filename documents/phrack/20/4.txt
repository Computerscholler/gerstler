                         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    As a final farewell, we've decided to release what remained on Metal Shop
Private at the time it went down.  We regret that due to our misjudgement some
of the messages were deleted because of the expiration date on the messages.
The following is a run through of the whole board program as if you were
logging on remotely.  Various explainations for various parts of the board will
be given in parentheses.

Hangup?  Sure? Yes

   Takin' off so soon?  Outta time?
Outta luck?  Well, come back soon and
remember not to spread this to every-
one and anyone...PRIVATE!  Keep

Well, that's pretty much all of what was on the board for the most part.  There
were a few more things like the format on the upper part of the screen which
was windowed off from what was happening on the board which contained the
on-line user's information and other things only the sysop would see, but
nothing about it was too interesting.  I hope you enjoyed seeing all of the
things contained on what used to be my board, and I hope you were both suprised
and let down at the same time.  That's the way it should be because it was, as
I so often said, over-rated.  Anyway, I'd like to acknowledge the fact that
both Control C and The Mad Hacker were going to run Metal Shop Private after my
problems arose, but Control C had some problems of his own and after he got the
program, he lost it and The Mad Hacker would have run it, but I received notice
about something concerning the board which convinced me to keep it down
forever.  It's all still intact like I said, but it's probably just going to
sit on my hard drive until my father needs more room on the hard drive for
Lotus 1-2-3 or something and it'll get formatted over.

Oh, one last note:  For those of you who thought you were hackers and attempted
to get my password (which never happened in the history of the board), it was
"ME?CRAZY", my phone number was MSP-314-SLAY, and the secondary password
necessary to log on as a sysop remotely was "LASHING."
