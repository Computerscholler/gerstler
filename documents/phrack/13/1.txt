                               ==Phrack Inc.==

                     Volume Two, Issue 13, Phile #1 of 10

                                   Index...
                                   ~~~~~~~~

         Well, as a tribute to April Fools Day (4/1/87) and as a break to the
normal grinding speed of Phrack Inc. (HA!), we at Phrack Inc. have taken a
break to be stupid, to get our frustrations out, to make fun of people,
places, and things, and to be just generally obnoxious.

         This issue was delayed due to THE EXECUTIONER who may be blamed for
the slow date release of this issue.  We currently believe him to be trekking
back to his home in the Himalayas to hide with his mom (Saskwatch).  Heh...
Just getting you in the mood for what's ahead.

         This issue is NOT to be taken seriously in any manner (except
anything mentioned about Oryan Quest) and is put together extremely loosely.
None of the files have been formatted.  None of the files have been spell-
checked.  Don't expect quality from this issue...just have fun.  Later.
