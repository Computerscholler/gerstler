 Comment:  I came across this article in Computer Shopper (Sept. 1987)  and it
   talked about citizens access government computers since we do pay  for them
   with our  taxpayers monies.  Since then, I have had  friends and gone  on a
   few myself  and the  databases are full of  information for accessing.  One
   thing, you usually have to call the sysop for access and give him your real
   name, address  and the like.  They call you back and verify your existence.
   Just a word of  warning; crashing a BBS is a crime, so I wouldn't fool with
   these since they are government based.

 I skipped listing a few of the BBSes in this article if the chances were slim
   to get  on or  if the BBS got a bad review.  Most of the ones listed seemed
   to have  lot of  informative files  for downloading  and viewing  pleasure.
   This article carried a very strong word of warning about tampering/crashing
   these since they are run by the govt. and a volunteer Sysop.  Since you can
   get on these legally why not use it?
