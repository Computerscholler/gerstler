Special thanks goes out to Henry Nussbacher who did the actual compiling of
this list.  For those of you on Bitnet, you may have seen this previously in
the form of BITNET GATES.

For readers who are a little unsure of what this file shows, I will try to
explain a little.  As you already know from the Future Transcendent Saga, there
are many different networks all around the world.  Most of these networks are
connected in some way, usually all being called the Internet.

Now, as you should know, Taran King and Knight Lighting both have addresses on
Bitnet that are on the node UMCVMB.BITNET.  However, this node also exists
on the Internet in a different form:  UMCVMB.MISSOURI.EDU.

EDU is the Internet domain for academic nodes.  Not every node on Bitnet has a
translation on the Internet.  Then again, only a small fraction of the
nodes on Internet have Bitnet equivalents.

So what this file really shows is what network you are sending mail to when you
have an address that contains a nodename or routing designation that looks a
little strange.  For people on Bitnet it also shows what Bitnet address serves
as the gateway between Bitnet and whichever network they are sending to on the
Internet.

The following is a table of gateways between Bitnet and other networks.  It is
in the format of;

Domain:       The upper level recognized name by the Columbia University VM
              mail system.

Name:         The descriptive name of this network.

Gateway:      Where the mail is sent to in Bitnet.  Unless otherwise specified,
              the gateway expects to receive a BSMTP (Batch Simple Mail
              Transfer Protocol) envelope.  Users in general do not need to
              worry about the contents of this field.  This is not a mailbox
              for general questions but rather the server machine (daemon) that
              acts as the transporter of mail from one network to another.
              Software postmasters are expected to configure their system so
              that their system sends to the nearest gateway and not to the
              default gateway.

Translation:  Upon occasion, certain addresses will be translated internally to
              point to an indirect gateway.  In such a case, the complete
              address is specified.

Bitnet - Internet Regional Gateways
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Below is a list of those sites that will handle regional traffic between
Bitnet and the Internet:

SMTP@CUNYVM
SMT@CORNELLC
MAILER@MITVMA
MAILER@ICNUCEVM - available only for Italian nodes

You should *ALWAYS* use the generic address of SMTP@INTERBIT and never any of
the addresses mentioned above.  The addresses stated above are for
informational and debugging purposes ONLY.  Failure to abide by this rule will
cause the owners of the gateway to close their service to all Bitnet and EARN
users.

Indirect Domains
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Domains that are unreachable directly, but that the Internet exit of Mailer
knows how to translate:

Domain:     DEC
Name:       Digital Equipment Internal Network (Easynet)
Gateway:    SMTP@INTERBIT
Sample:     user@domain.DEC
Translated to: user%node.DEC@DECWRL.DEC.COM

Domain:     OZ (soon to become OZ.AU)
Name:       Australian University Network
Gateway:    SMTP@INTERBIT
Sample:     user@node.OZ
Translated to: user%node.OZ@UUNET.UU.NET


Domains that are unreachable directly but that are accessible by specifying the
address explicitly:

Name:       Xerox Internal Use Only Network (Grapevine)
Sample:     user.Registry@Xerox.Com

Name:       IBM Internal Use Only Network (VNET)
Sample:     user@Vnet

Comments:   1) Mail must be sent directly to user and not via a 3rd party
               mailer (i.e. VM Mailer server)
            2) User within Vnet must first receive approval within IBM to
               establish a circuit and then initiate a virtual circuit.  A user
               within Bitnet may not establish communications with a VNET user,
               without the above requirement.
            3) This gateway is only open to selected nodes within IBM which
               have ties with academia (i.e. ACIS).
