TIRKS (Trunks Integrated Records Keeping System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         TIRKS is the master record-keeping system for the network.  It
supports network operations related to growth and change in the network by
providing accurate records of circuits and components that are in use and
available for use.  It was developed to mechanize the circuit-provisioning
process.  Two circuit-provisioning aspects are applied: daily circuit
provisioning and current planning.
         Daily circuit provisioning is processing orders to satisfy customer
needs for special service circuits and processing orders initiated for message
trunks and carrier systems for the PSTN.  The process begins at various
operations centers and ends up at the CPCs (Circuit Provision Centers) which
track orders, design circuits, and assign the components using TIRKS.  It also
prepares work packages and distributes them to technicians working in the field
who implement them.
         Current planning determines the equipment and facility requirements
for future new circuits. It apportions forecasts for circuits among the circuit
designs planned for new circuits.
         TIRKS consists of five major interacting component systems:  COC
(Circuit Order Control system), E1 (Equipment system), F1 (Facility system), C1
(Circuit system), and FEPS (Facility and Equipment Planning System).

         o COC controls message trunk orders, special-services orders, and
           carrier system orders by tracking critical dates throughout the
           existence of an order as it flows from the source to the CPC and on
           to the field forces.  It provides management with the current status
           of all circuit orders and provides data to other TIRKS component
           systems to update the assigned status of equipment, facilities, and
           circuits as orders are processed.

         o C1 is the heart of TIRKS.  It automatically determines the types of
           equipment required for a given circuit, assigns the equipment and
           facilities needed, determines levels at the various transmission
           level points on the circuit, specifies the test requirements, and
           establishes circuit records for the circuits.  All records of
           circuits already installed are kept in C1 for future additions or
           changes.

         o E1 is one of the two major inventory component systems in TIRKS.
           It contains equipment inventory records, assignment records, and
           pending equipment orders.  The records show the amount of spare
           equipment that is available and equipment's circuit identification.

         o F1 is the other of the major inventory component systems.  It
           contains cable and carrier inventory and assigns records.

         o FEPS supports the current planning process which determines the
           transmission facilities and equipment that will be required for new
           service. It uses data in E1, F1, and C1 as well as other forecasts
           to allocate existing inventories efficiently, to determine future
           facility and equipment requirements, and to update planning
           designs.

         TIRKS uses IBM-370 compatible hardware and direct-access storage
devices.  It provides benefits to the BOCs through improved service to
customers, capital and expense savings, and better management control.


PICS (Plug-in Inventory Control System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         PICS is the mechanized operations system developed for the efficient
management of large amounts of equipment inventories.  It assists with both
inventory and materials management.  Inventory managers establish corporate
policies for the types of equipment and for equipment utilization, assist
engineering organizations in introducing new types of equipment while phasing
out older types, and set utilization goals that balance service objectives and
carrying charges on spare equipment.  Material managers work to achieve
utilization goals by acquiring spare equipment for growth and maintenance
purposes.  They also administer a hierarchy of locations used for storing spare
equipment.
         PICS/DCPR (PICS with Detailed Continuing Property Records) administers
all types of CO equipment.  The DCPR portion of PICS/DCPR serves as a detailed
investment database supporting accounting records for all types of CO plug-in
and "hardwired" equipment.  PICS/DCPR accomplishes its goals of increasing
utilization, decreasing manual effort, and providing a detailed supporting
record for phone company investment through software, databases, administrative
procedures, and workflows.
         Two new functional entities are created in the BOC first:  PIA
(Plug-In Administration) and the central stock.  PIA is the materials manager
and is responsible for acquiring equipment, distributing it as needed to field
locations, repairing it, and accounting for it.  The central stock is a
warehouse where spare equipment is consolidated and managed.
         There are five subsystems in PICS/DCPR:

         o  Plug-in inventory subsystem -  maintains order, repair, and
            inventory records for all types of plug-in equipment.

         o  Inventory management subsystem - provides the PIA with mechanized
            processes to assist in various tasks.

         o  Plug-in DCPR subsystem - provides processes required to maintain
            investment records for plug-in units.

         o  Hardwired DCPR subsystem - maintains detailed accounting records
            for hardwired CO equipment.

         o  Reference file subsystem - provides and maintains reference data
            used by all other subsystems.

         PICS/DCPR runs on IBM-compatible equipment with the IBM Information
Management System database manager.  It interfaces with TIRKS as well as a few
other circuit-provisioning systems.


PREMIS (PREMises Information System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         PREMIS provides fast, convenient access to information needed to
respond to service requests.  It was developed in response to the need for
address standardization.  It has three mechanized databases:  address data, a
credit file, and a list of available telephone numbers.  It also serves a
function to the LAC (Loop Assignment Center), called PREMIS/LAC.  PREMIS/LAC is
an extension of the address database and provides for the storage of outside
plant facility data at each address entry.
         PREMIS supports the following service representative tasks:

         o  Determining the customer's correct address.  The address related-
            and address-keyable information is the major feature of PREMIS.
            If an input request does not contain an accurate or complete
            address, PREMIS displays information that can be used to query the
            customer.  The address database allows PREMIS to give the full
            address and information about the geographic area which includes WC
            (Wire Center), exchange area, tax area, directory group, and the
            service features available for that area.  It also displays
            existing or previous customer's name and telephone number, modular
            jacking arrangement at the address, and an indication of whether a
            connect outside plant loop from the address back to the CO was left
            in place.  If service was discontinued at the site, the reason for
            disconnect and the date of disconnect are also displayed.

         o  Negotiating service features.  PREMIS indicates the service
            features that can be sold at that address, providing useful
            information for discussing these with a customer.

         o  Negotiating a service date.  If it indicates that an outside plant
            loop back to the CO has been left in place, PREMIS allows for
            earlier installation as no installer will need to visit the site.

         o  Checking a customer's credit status.  PREMIS maintains a
            name-keyable file of customers with outstanding debts to the
            telephone company.  If there is a match in the database, the
            customer's file is displayed.

         o  Selecting a telephone number.  There is a file in PREMIS listing
            all available telephone numbers from which service representatives
            request numbers for a specific address.  The available telephone
            numbers are read from COSMOS (COmputer System for Mainframe
            OperationS) magnetic tape.

         PREMIS/LAC has a feature called DPAC (Dedicated Plant Assignment
Card).  Records of addresses where outside plant loop facilities are dedicated
are organized and accessed by address by the LAC through DPAC.
         PREMIS is an on-line interactive system whose prime users are service
representatives interacting with customers.  It uses the UNIVAC 1100 as its
main computer.  It has network links to various other computer systems, too,
to obtain various pieces of information that are helpful or necessary in
efficiently completing service functions.


TNDS (Total Network Data System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         TNDS is actually a large and complex set of coordinated systems which
supports a broad range of activities that depend on accurate traffic data.  It
is more of a concept that incorporates various subsystems as opposed to a
single computer system.  It consists of both manual procedures and computer
systems that provide operating company managers with comprehensive, timely, and
accurate network information that helps in analysis of the network.  TNDS
supports operations centers responsible for administration of the trunking
network, network data collection, daily surveillance of the load on the
switching network, the utilization of equipment by the switching network, and
the design of local and CO switching equipment to meet future service needs.
         TNDS modules that collect and format traffic data usually have
dedicated minicomputers which are at the operating company's Minicomputer
Maintenance (Operations) Center (MMOC/MMC).  Other modules generate engineering
and administrative reports on switching systems and on the trunking network of
message trunks that interconnects them.  These mostly run on general-purpose
computers.  Still others are located in AT&T centers and are accessed by
various operating companies for data.
         The functions of TNDS are carried out by various computer systems
since TNDS itself is just a concept.  These subsystems include EADAS, EADAS/NM,
TDAS, CU/EQ, LBS, 5XB COER, SPCS COER, ICAN, SONDS, TSS, CU/TK, TFS, and CSAR.
The following sections cover these systems briefly.


EADAS (Engineering and Administrative Data Acquisition System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         EADAS is the major data collecting system of TNDS and runs on a
dedicated minicomputer at the NDCC (Network Data Collection Center).  Each
EADAS serves up to fifty switching offices.  The 4ESS and No. 4 XBAR both have
their own data acquisition systems built into the switch and they feed their
data directly to other TNDS component systems that are downstream from EADAS,
thereby bypassing the need for EADAS on those switches.  EADAS summarizes data
collected for processing by downstream TNDS systems and does so in real-time.
EADAS is used by network administrators to determine quality of service and to
identify switching problems.  It also makes additional real-time information
available to these administrators by providing traffic data history that covers
up to 48 hours.  This data history is flexible through the module NORGEN
(Network Operations Report GENerator) so that administrators can tailor their
requests for information to determine specifics.  Information from EADAS is
forwarded to other downstream systems in TNDS via data links or magnetic tape.


EADAS/NM (EADAS/Network Management)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         EADAS/NM is one of the three TNDS systems that EADAS forwards traffic
data downstream to either by data links or magnetic tape.  EADAS/NM uses data
directly from EADAS as well as receiving data from those switching systems
which do not interface with EADAS previously mentioned.  It monitors switching
systems and trunk groups designated by network managers and reports existing or
anticipated congestion on a display board at local and regional NMCs (Network
Management Centers).  It is used to analyze problems in near real-time to
determine their location and causes.  EADAS/NM provides information that
requires national coordination to the AT&T Long Lines NOC (Network Operations
Center) in Bedminster, NJ which uses it's NOCS (NOC System) to perform
EADAS/NM-like functions on a national scale.  Like EADAS, EADAS/NM uses
dedicated minicomputers to provide interactive real-time response and control.


TDAS (Traffic Data Administration System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         The second of three TNDS systems that is downstream from EADAS is TDAS
which formats the traffic data for use by most of the other downstream systems.
It accepts data from EADAS, local vendor systems, and large toll switching
systems on a weekly basis as magnetic tape.  It functions basically as a
warehouse and distribution facility for the traffic data and runs a batch
system at the computation center.  Correct association between recorded traffic
data and the switching or trunking elements is the result of shared information
between TDAS and CU/EQ. Data processed through TDAS is matched against that
stored in CU/EQ.  The data is summarized weekly on magnetic tape or printout
and is sent for use in preparation of an engineering or administrative report.


CU/EQ (Common Update/EQuipment)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         CU/EQ is a master database which stores traffic measurements taken by
TDAS and it shares information with TDAS, ICAN and LBS.  As said before,
correct association between recorded traffic data and the switching or trunking
elements is due to the shared information between CU/EQ and TDAS.  It runs as a
batch system in the same computer as TDAS and is regularly updated with batch
transactions to keep it current with changes in the physical arrangement of CO
switching machines which ensures that recorded measurements are treated
consistently in each of the reporting systems that use CU/EQ records.


ICAN (Individual Circuit ANalysis)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         The final of the three systems downstream from EADAS is ICAN, which
also uses data directly from EADAS but uses CU/EQ for reference information.
It is a CO reporting system which detects electromechanical switching system
faults by identifying abnormal load patterns on individual circuits within a
circuit group.  ICAN produces a series of reports used by the NAC (Network
Administration Center) to analyze the individual circuits and to verify that
such circuits are being correctly associated with their respective groups.


LBS (Load Balance System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         LBS is a batch-executed system that helps assure the network
administrator that traffic loads in each switching system are uniformly
distributed.  It analyzes the traffic data to establish traffic loads on each
line group of the switching system.  The NAC uses the resulting reports to
determine the lightly loaded line groups to which new subscriber lines can be
assigned.  LBS also calculates load balance indices for each system and
aggregates the results for the entire BOC.


5XB COER (No. 5 Crossbar Central Office Equipment Reports)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         The 5XB COER provides information on common-control switching
equipment operation for different types of switching systems.  It is a
batch-executed system that runs on a BOC mainframe that analyzes traffic data
to determine how heavily various switching system components are used and
measures certain service parameters.  It calculates capacity for the No. 5
Crossbar.  Network administrators use 5XB COER reports to monitor day-to-day
switching performance, diagnose potential switching malfunctions, and help
predict future service needs.  Traffic engineers rely on reports to assess
switching office capacity and to forecast equipment requirements.  It produces
busy hour and busy season reports so service and traffic load measurements can
be most useful in predictions.


SPCS COER (Stored-Program Control Systems Central Office Equipment Reports)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         The SPCS COER is basically the same as the 5XB COER as it too monitors
switching system service and  measures utilization in the same manners as
mentioned above.  The essential differences between the 5XB COER and the SPCS
COER are that the latter calculates capacity for 1ESS, 2ESS, and 3ESS switching
offices as opposed to the No. 5 Crossbar switch and SPCS COER is an interactive
system that runs on a centralized AT&T mainframe computer.


SONDS (Small Office Network Data System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         SONDS collects its own data from small step-by-step offices
independently of EADAS and TDAS.  It performs a full range of data manipulation
functions and provides a number of TNDS features economically for smaller
electromechanical step-by-step offices.  The data collected is directly from
the offices being measured.  It processes the data and automatically
distributes weekly, monthly, exception, and on-demand reports to managers at
the NACs via dial-up terminals.  SONDS runs on an interactive basis at a
centralized AT&T mainframe computer.

CU/TK (Common Update/TrunKing)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         CU/TK is a database system that contains the trunking network
information and as well as other information required by TSS (Trunking
Servicing System) and TFS (Trunk Forecasting System).  The CU/TK is regularly
updated by CAC (Circuit Administration Center) by personnel to keep it current
with changes in the physical arrangements of trunks and switching machines in
the CO.  For correct trunking and switching configuration in the processing by
TSS and TFS, this updating process, which includes maintaining office growth
information and a "common-language" circuit identification of all circuits for
individual switching machines, ensures that traffic data provided by TDAS will
be correctly associated.


TSS (Trunk Servicing System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         TSS helps trunk administrators develop short-term plans and determine
the number of circuits required in a trunk group.  Data from TDAS is processed
in TSS and the offered load for each trunk group is computed.  Through offered
load calculation on a per-trunk-group basis, TSS calculates the number of
trunks theoretically required to handle that traffic load at a designated grade
of service.  TSS produces weekly reports showing which trunk groups have too
many trunks and which have too few that are performing below the
grade-of-service objective.  Trunk orders to add or disconnect trunks are made
by the CAC after they use the information provided through TSS.


TFS (Trunk Forecasting System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         TFS uses traffic load data computed by TSS as well as information on
the network configuration and forecasting parameters stored in the CU/TK
database for long-term construction planning for new trunks.  TFS forecasts
message trunk requirements for the next five years as the fundamental input to
the planning process that leads to the provisioning of additional facilities.


CSAR (Centralized System for Analysis and Reporting)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         CSAR is designed to monitor and measure how well data is being
processed through TNDS.  It collects and analyzes data from other TNDS systems
and provides operating company personnel at NDCCs, NACs, and CACs with
quantitative measures of the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the TNDS
data flow as well as the consistency of the TNDS record bases.  CSAR also
presents enough information to locate and identify a data collection problem.
CSAR summarizes the results of its TNDS monitoring for the company as input to
the TPMP (TNDS Performance Measurement Plan) which is published monthly by
AT&T.  CSAR runs as a centralized on-line interactive system at an AT&T
computer center.  Its data is placed into special files, which, at the end of a
CSAR run, are merged and transferred to the AT&T computer center.  CSAR
performs the proper associations and analyzes each system's results.  These
results are obtained by company managers via dial-up and they can be arranged
in a number of formats that provide details on overall TNDS performance or
individual system effectiveness.  Specific problems can also be identified
through these reports.


The following is a diagram of data flow among TNDS systems:

                                                      other TNDS Systems


SCCS (Switching Control Center System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         The Switching Control Center (SCC) was created to centralize the
administration, maintenance, and control of the 1ESS switching system.  By
using the remote-interaction interfacing of the MCC (Master Control Center),
which is a frame of equipment in a 1ESS system that indicates the current state
of the office equipment, the SCC functions as the centralized maintenance
center for the switch.
         At the SCC, a minicomputer system called the CSS (Computer Sub-System)
is added and along with the equipment units that remote the MCC, it makes up
the SCCS.  The CSS can support a number of SCCs.  Generally, the CSS is located
in the MMOC.  Basically, a number of switches are handled by each SCC and the
various SCCs are handled by the CSS.
         The SCCS contains maintenance and administrative data that is sent
directly from the switches. Through the SCCS, a technician can remotely operate
the MCC keys on the switches hooked up to it as well as perform any available
command or task supported by the switch.  The SCCS can handle up to 30 or more
offices although usually only 15 or so are handled per SCC.  This number
depends also on the size of the offices and the amount of data that is
transmitted.
         Major alarms that sound at a switching office set off alarms at the
SCC within seconds and it also causes an update of the status of the office on
the critical indicator panel and it displays a specific description of the
alarm condition on a CRT alarm monitor at a workstation.  Software enhancements
to the SCCS fall into four broad classes:

         o  Enhanced Alarming - Besides alarms sounding, incoming data can
            generate failure descriptions for easy interpretation and
            real-time analysis techniques.

         o  Interaction with Message History - Using past information on a
            switch's troubles, the SCCS allows pertinent information on a
            specific switch to be provided in case of an alarm.

         o  Mechanization of Craft Functions - Certain conditions no longer
            need to be looked into directly.  If an alarm goes off, the SCCS
            can perform routine tests and fix the problem as best it can or
            else, if that doesn't work, a trouble ticket is issued.

         o  Support for Switch Administration - Through the SCCS, data can be
            sent automatically to different operations centers as well as
            other operations systems which require data from the switches.

         Since the original SCCS came into operation, many changes have taken
place.  The current SCCS supports all of the entire ESS family of switches as
well as network transmission equipment and it also can maintain several
auxiliary processor systems, like TSPS (Traffic Service Position System) and
AIS (Automatic Intercept System), and supports network transmission equipment.


COEES (Central Office Equipment Engineering System)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         COEES is a time-sharing system that runs on a DEC PDP-10.  It is the
standard system for planning and engineering local switching equipment.  COEES
contains component systems for Step-By-Step, Crossbar, 1/1AESS, and 2/2BESS
switching systems, each of which has a different capability.
         The COEES database stores information obtained from forecasts for each
local switching office on number of lines of all types, number of trunks of all
types, average call rate per line and trunk, average usage per line and trunk,
and all features, signaling types, etc. that are required.  COEES determines
the quantity of each type of equipment in the office needed to satisfy the
forecasted load at objective service levels, determines an estimated price for
engineering, procuring, and installing the equipment addition needed to reach
the require level, and then it sums up the costs of doing it eight different
ways for the network designer to review.  The system also takes into account
varying parameters like call rate or proportion of lines with certain features
which is called sensitivity analysis.
         With the information provided by the COEES forecast, the designer can
then make a recommendation.  After a decision is made on the recommendation,
COEES prints out an order so that the additional equipment can more quickly and
easily be obtained.
         COEES also puts out a report called call store on a 1ESS, which tells
the engineer and the equipment supplier how much memory to allocate to
different functions in the switch depending on inputs that the engineer
provides to the system.


MATFAP (Metropolitan Area Transmission Facility Analysis Program)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
         MATFAP is a computer program that aids in facility planning.  It
analyzes the alternatives available to the operating company for its future
transmission equipment and facilities using present worth of future expenses
and other measures.
         By combining trunk and special-service circuit forecasts with
switching plans, network configuration, cost data, and engineering rules,
MATFAP can identify what transmission plant will be needed at various locations
and when it will be needed.  It also determines economic consequences of
specific facility and/or equipment selections as well as routing choices and it
provides the least-cost assignment of circuits to each facility as a guide to
the circuit-provisioning process.  It is oriented towards metropolitan networks
and facilities/equipment found in those regions.
         MATFAP provides two benefits.  It helps automate the transmission-
planning process and it takes into account economies that cannot be identified
by restricted analysis.  It also balances circuit loads on high-capacity
digital lines with additional multiplex equipment.  Data from MATFAP is edited
through RDES (Remote Data Entry System).


Various Operating Systems
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The following is a list of other operating systems used by the Bell System with
brief descriptions:

ATRS (Automated Trouble Reporting System) - aids in the analysis of trouble
%%%%     reports by sorting, formatting, forwarding, and examining them from
         the entire country for standard errors

%%%%%%   operations system that automates trouble location procedures that
         identify faulty circuit packs in a switch when trouble is detected
         and diagnosed
CMDS (Centralized Message Data System) - analyzes the AMA tapes to determine
%%%%     traffic patterns
COSMOS (COmputer System for Mainframe OperationS) - stores the full inventory
%%%%%%   of telephone numbers

%%%%     database
CRS (Centralized Results System) - a management information system that
%%%      automates the collection, analysis, and publication of many
         measurement results
CUCRIT (Capital Utilization CRITeria) - used mainly for project economic
%%%%%%   evaluation and capital budgeting and planning
DACS (Digital Access Cross-connect System) - remote digital access for testing
%%%%     of special-service circuits in analog or digital form
EFRAP (Exchange Feeder Route Analysis Program) - used in planning of the loop
%%%%%    network
IFRPS (Intercity Facility Relief Planning System) - also like MATFAP but deals
%%%%%    with radio and coaxial cable as opposed to voice-frequency facilities
IPLAN (Integrated PLanning And Analysis system) - used mainly for project
%%%%%    economic evaluation
LMOS (Loop Maintenance Operations System) - maintenance outages on loops
%%%%     remotely by a service employee
LRAP (Long Route Analysis Program) - like EFRAP, used in planning of the loop
%%%%     network

%%%%     switching systems
SARTS (Switched Access Remote Test System) - accessed to perform sophisticated
%%%%%    tests on most types of special-service circuits
SMAS (Switched Maintenance Access System) - through the use of relays,
%%%%     provides concentrated metallic access to individual circuits to
         permit remote access and testing by SARTS
TASC (Telecommunications Alarm Surveillance and Control System) - an alarm
%%%%     program that identifies the station and transmits it back to the
         central maintenance location
TCAS (T-Carrier Administration System) - an operations system responsible for
%%%%     T-carrier alarms
TCSP (Tandem Cross Section Program) - a program for analysis of traffic
%%%%     network planning
TFLAP (T-carrier Fault-Locating Application Program) - a subprogram of
%%%%%    Universal Cable Circuit Analysis Program which analyzes networks with
